    <h2 class="section-title" style="margin-bottom:2rem;">Essential <em>Sci-Fi</em></h2>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Science fiction is arguably the most important genre of the last century — it's where we process our anxieties about technology, explore what it means to be human, and imagine radically different futures.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For hard sci-fi:</strong> Start with Arthur C. Clarke's <em>Rendezvous with Rama</em> or Kim Stanley Robinson's <em>Red Mars</em>. Both take the science seriously without sacrificing story.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For space opera:</strong> Iain M. Banks' Culture novels (start with <em>Consider Phlebas</em>) or Alastair Reynolds' <em>Revelation Space</em>. Both are vast, intelligent, and utterly transportive.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For cyberpunk:</strong> William Gibson's <em>Neuromancer</em> invented the genre and still reads like the future. Neal Stephenson's <em>Snow Crash</em> is the funniest important book in sci-fi.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:2.5rem;"><strong>For short stories:</strong> Ted Chiang's <em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em> is the gold standard of modern sci-fi short fiction. Each story is a precisely constructed thought experiment.</p>
