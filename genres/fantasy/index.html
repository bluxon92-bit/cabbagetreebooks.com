    <h2 class="section-title" style="margin-bottom:2rem;">Essential <em>Fantasy</em></h2>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Fantasy is the oldest form of storytelling — myths, legends, and tales of impossible things have been with us since before writing. The modern genre stretches from Tolkien's foundational world-building to Joe Abercrombie's brutal deconstruction of its tropes.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For epic fantasy:</strong> Begin with Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> if you haven't, then move to Brandon Sanderson's <em>The Way of Kings</em> for modern world-building at its most ambitious.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For grimdark:</strong> Joe Abercrombie's <em>The Blade Itself</em> is the genre's defining text. Follow it with Mark Lawrence's <em>Prince of Thorns</em> or John Gwynne's <em>Malice</em>.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For character-driven fantasy:</strong> Robin Hobb's <em>Assassin's Apprentice</em> is one of the finest character studies in any genre. Patrick Rothfuss's <em>The Name of the Wind</em> is stunning prose in a fantasy setting.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:2.5rem;"><strong>For short fantasy:</strong> Ursula K. Le Guin's <em>The Wind's Twelve Quarters</em> remains the benchmark for short-form fantasy — precise, mythic, and quietly devastating.</p>
