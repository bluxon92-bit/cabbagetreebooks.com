    <h2 class="section-title" style="margin-bottom:2rem;">Essential <em>Horror</em></h2>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Horror at its best does something no other genre can: it makes the familiar terrifying. Whether it's the creeping dread of Shirley Jackson or the cosmic indifference of Lovecraft, the best horror books leave you changed.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For psychological horror:</strong> Shirley Jackson's <em>The Haunting of Hill House</em> is the definitive text — a novel about how perception distorts reality, and it's genuinely frightening.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For cosmic horror:</strong> Start with Lovecraft's <em>The Call of Cthulhu</em>, then move to modern cosmic horror: Paul Tremblay's <em>A Head Full of Ghosts</em> or Jeff VanderMeer's <em>Annihilation</em>.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><strong>For Stephen King:</strong> <em>The Shining</em> remains his finest novel. <em>Pet Sematary</em> is his darkest. <em>It</em> is the most ambitious. Start with <em>The Shining</em>.</p>
    <p style="font-size:1rem; color:var(--ink-soft); line-height:1.9; margin-bottom:2.5rem;"><strong>For short horror:</strong> King's <em>Night Shift</em> is the best horror short story collection in the language. Shirley Jackson's <em>The Lottery and Other Stories</em> is quieter and more devastating.</p>
