[Verity by Colleen Hoover](https://amzn.to/3PNOacR) was recommended to me by a friend who described it as amazing and mind-blowing. Intrigued I did a bit of digging and could find only good things online so I downloaded onto my kindle and embarked on a reading journey that left me stunned, particularly in the final moments.

Verity by Colleen Hoover revolves around the protagonist Lowen Ashleigh who is a struggling writer in New York City, grappling with financial hardships and a sense of unfulfillment. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she crosses paths with a man who will profoundly impact her in more ways than one.

Right from the first line [Verity](https://amzn.to/3PNOacR) delivers jolting shocks that have you flicking through the pages to uncover the book’s secrets. The secondary protagonists are a rich and engaging cast. I found the book on the whole very well-paced and entertaining, albeit with some predictability setting in during the final third.

Without revealing too much the plot’s promise is that Lowen finds herself tasked with completing a book series for a renowned author. Her journey takes her to the home of the author's husband, where she delves into his notes to gain a deeper understanding of how to finish the remaining books but uncovers a [horrifying](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/5-bone-chilling-horror-short-story-collections-by-stephen-king) truth.

Colleen Hoover may not excel in intricate prose, but her story was definitely engaging and largely kept me guessing until the final pages. The novel verity instils you with a growing and constant sense of unease from those first pages. Additionally, if the book doesn't resonate with you, it's worth noting that it is relatively short - I finished it over just a couple of sittings - so you won't have to wait long to move on to your next read.

## Verity Characters - 4/5

Hoover presents us with [believable and emotionally raw characters](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/how-to-write-believable-characters) in Verity. Some personalities evoke genuine fear, while others compel us to root for them. Lowen, the main protagonist, is immensely likeable. She exudes nervousness and suspicion, yet isn't afraid to speak her mind.

On the other hand, Crawford, our secondary protagonist, initially comes across as less captivating. He carries the weight of past hurts, resulting in a reserved and quiet demeanour. Admittedly, I found him somewhat dull at first, but he gradually grows on you, thanks to an element of mystery surrounding him.

## Summary of Verity by Colleen Hoover - 4/5

[Verity](https://amzn.to/3PNOacR) was heralded as one of the best books by many readers on social media. However, reviewing this book is a little challenging. The first 95% maintains and builds tension well, but proved predictable in places. However, the final pages completely upended everything, leaving me unsure whether it was a stroke of brilliance that elevated an otherwise average novel, or a convenient plot device employed by Hoover to give the story a little more meaning.

Because of this, Verity will either ‘blow your mind’ or potentially just leave you frustrated, and I find myself sitting somewhere in the middle. I definitely enjoyed it, but I remain puzzled by the extent of the adoration expressed about it online.
