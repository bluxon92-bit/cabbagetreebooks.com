Both books appear on the same recommendation lists constantly. Both have passionate advocates. Both feature strong female protagonists, dragons, complex politics, and enormous page counts. If you've been told to read one or both and aren't sure where to start, this direct comparison should help.

The short version: they're much more different than they appear on the surface. The right choice depends entirely on what you're looking for.

## The Basics

**The Priory of the Orange Tree** by Samantha Shannon is a standalone epic fantasy — 848 pages, complete story, no sequels required. It's influenced by East Asian mythology, features three female POV characters, and is fundamentally a book about the politics of religion and the relationship between different cultures. The romance is present but not the engine. [Full review here.](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/the-priory-of-the-orange-tree-review)

**A Court of Thorns and Roses** by Sarah J. Maas is the first book in a five-book series. It begins as a Beauty and the Beast retelling, becomes something considerably more adult and explicit by Book 2, and has a romantic relationship — several, actually — at its absolute centre. The world-building is rich but the emotional core is the love story. [Full series guide here.](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/sarah-j-maas-books-in-order)

## What They Have in Common

Both books feature female protagonists in secondary world fantasy settings with magic, political intrigue, and high stakes. Both have devoted fanbases who will tell you the books changed their reading lives. Both are longer than average. Both involve a form of arranged or dangerous proximity romance (to varying degrees). Both take their female characters seriously.

## How They Differ

**Tone.** Priory is consistently serious — literary in ambition if not always in execution, political in concern, interested in historical forces more than individual feelings. ACOTAR starts lighter, becomes darker, and is always emotionally immediate in a way Priory isn't. Maas wants you to feel everything in real time; Shannon wants you to understand a world.

**Romance.** In ACOTAR, the romance is the main event. In Priory, it's a thread within a larger tapestry. If you're primarily a romance reader who also enjoys fantasy, ACOTAR is clearly the choice. If you find heavy romantic focus frustrating in what you want to be primarily a fantasy novel, Priory is yours.

**Series commitment.** Priory requires nothing — one book, complete story. ACOTAR requires at minimum Books 1-3 to reach a satisfying conclusion, and many readers find the early volumes work best understood as a very long opening act for *A Court of Mist and Fury*. That's a 1,500-page investment before you reach what most fans consider the series at its best.

**Explicitness.** Priory has a same-sex romance handled with real warmth but minimal explicitness. ACOTAR becomes progressively more adult across the series. If explicit content isn't what you're looking for, Priory is the safer choice.

**Dragons.** Both books feature dragons prominently, but with completely different approaches. In Priory, dragons are sacred, culturally specific, and rendered with genuine awe. In the wider Maas universe they appear more as power symbols than as individuals.

## The Verdict

**Read Priory if:** You want a complete, standalone story. You prefer world-building and politics to romance as primary concerns. You want something with genuine literary ambition. You prefer a self-contained commitment.

**Read ACOTAR if:** You're happy committing to a longer series. You want the romance front and centre. You like the experience of a world that expands dramatically across multiple books. You want something propulsive and emotionally intense.

**Read both if:** You have the time. They scratch genuinely different itches and the readers who love one don't always love the other, but those who love both get something distinct from each.
