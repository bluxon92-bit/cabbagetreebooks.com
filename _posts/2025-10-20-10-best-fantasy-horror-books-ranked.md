When it comes to fantasy horror books, I’m always on the lookout for stories that balance fantastical worldbuilding with a genuine chill that lingers long after the final page.

Whether you’re drawn to modern urban nightmares, twisted fairy tales, or gothic adventures steeped in myth, the following ranked list offers a range of voices and styles. Here are my top 10 picks for anyone in search of a thrilling new read.

### 1. Coraline by Neil Gaiman

There's something irresistibly eerie about stepping through a mysterious door into a world that mirrors—and distorts—our own.

[**Coraline**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0380807343?tag=ctbooks09e-20) taps into childhood curiosity and fear with its tale of a brave young girl who discovers an alternate version of her family, complete with button-eyed doppelgängers. Gaiman's playful yet macabre storytelling pulled me into a realm of captivating dread and wonder.

If you haven't read it yet, I guarantee you'll be checking over your shoulder every time you pass a closed door.

### 2. Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury

This timeless classic is a beautifully written plunge into the duality of innocence and corruption. Bradbury's tale of a sinister carnival arriving in a small town had me rethinking what lies hidden in the shadows of everyday life.

[**Something Wicked This Way Comes**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0380729407?tag=ctbooks09e-20) with its lyrical prose and unsettling themes of lost youth and creeping evil makes it a fantasy horror book that is as poetic as it is terrifying.

### 3. The Changeling by Victor LaValle

If you're after a modern fairy-tale with a dark twist, [**The Changeling**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812995945?tag=ctbooks09e-20) delivers an experience that is both emotionally rich and disturbingly vivid. LaValle reimagines folklore by blending urban grit with supernatural terror, a story where the magic of ancient myths meets the complexities of modern life. I was truly moved by how LaValle explores contemporary fears and family dynamics through a fantastical lens.

### 4. Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo

Diving into the occult and dark academia, [**Ninth House**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250313074?tag=ctbooks09e-20) offers a unique cocktail of supernatural mystery and campus intrigue set against the backdrop of Yale University.

Bardugo's exploration of secret societies and hidden rituals was both intellectually engaging and frightfully immersive.

This book completely redefined my idea of what [fantasy horror books](https://www.benluxonauthor.com/blog/5-bone-chilling-horror-short-story-collections-by-stephen-king) can be when they intersect with real-life settings and institutions.

### 5. The Tooth Fairy by Graham Joyce

Joyce’s *The Tooth Fairy* transforms a familiar childhood myth into something darkly subversive. This novel isn’t your typical nostalgic bedtime story; it’s a haunting narrative that oscillates between the grotesque and the tender, capturing the tumultuous emotions of growing up.

The androgynous, mischievous sprite that visits young Sam is at once both repellent and oddly protective—a combination that left me thinking long after I closed the book.

### 6. Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia

A more recent entry into the genre, [**Mexican Gothic**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/052562080X?tag=ctbooks09e-20) is a sumptuous gothic horror novel with a fresh twist. Set in 1950s Mexico, this story follows a determined young woman as she uncovers horrifying secrets in a decaying mansion.

Moreno-Garcia masterfully intertwines dark supernatural elements with historical and cultural depth, creating an unforgettable atmosphere that's equal parts lush and menacing.

### 7. The Blacktongue Thief by Christopher Buehlman

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/067c639b-e3b1-461d-9de3-9d8f827187d1/library+at+mount+char+book+cover+%281%29.jpg)

For those who crave a dose of dark humor mixed with high stakes and grim adventure, [**The Blacktongue Thief**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/125079997X?tag=ctbooks09e-20) is a wild ride.

Buehlman's novel introduces me to a world where a cunning thief navigates a brutal, beautifully grim landscape filled with sorcery and snark. I found the biting wit and vivid, often macabre imagery to be both refreshing and relentlessly entertaining.

### 8. The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins

This book is an absolute mind-bender!

An unpredictable, sometimes surreal plunge into a universe governed by bizarre, esoteric laws. [**The Library at Mount Char**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0553418629?tag=ctbooks09e-20) weaves elements of cosmic horror and dark fantasy into a narrative about forbidden knowledge and otherworldly power.

I was captivated by its audacious storytelling and intricate mythos that kept me guessing at every twist.

### 9. House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski

A true cult classic, [**House of Leaves**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0375703764?tag=ctbooks09e-20) redefines what a book can be. Its experimental format—replete with unconventional typography, footnotes, and layered narratives—draws you into a horrifying tale of a house that is impossibly larger on the inside than the outside.

This is a [fantasy horror](https://www.benluxonauthor.com/blog/horror-short-stories) that challenges your perception and invites deep, lingering unease, making it one of the most memorable reads in my collection.

### 10. The Sandman: Preludes & Nocturnes by Neil Gaiman

Though it’s a graphic novel rather than a traditional prose work, *The Sandman: Preludes & Nocturnes* is a cornerstone of the fantasy horror genre. Gaiman’s blend of mythology, dreams, and existential dread creates a rich, immersive universe that has influenced countless works. I was swept away by the poetic narrative and haunting visuals that speak to the darker side of human imagination and myth, making it an essential read for any fan of fantasy horror books.

### Bonus: The Eyes of the Dragon by Stephen King

No list of horror recommendations is complete without a nod to Stephen King, the undisputed king of horror. Whilst not specifically horror per se, King’s *The Eyes of the Dragon* is a unique, more overtly fantastical work by King that still carries an undercurrent of dark tension.

I found it to be an enchanting tale that bridges the gap between the fantastical and the fearful—an excellent bonus pick for those who appreciate King’s storytelling genius.
