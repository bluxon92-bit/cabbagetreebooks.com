This beautifully written novel about Greek mythology offers an alternate perspective from the point of view of Circe the Witch. Circe is most famously known for capturing Odysseus and turning his men into pigs during Homer’s The Odyssey.

It begins with Circe’s childhood in the house of Helios, the mighty Titan of the sun. Unlike her powerful father and alluring mother, Circe appears to possess no godlike abilities and finds herself shunned for her plainness.

Eventually, she discovers a power for witchcraft and after creating a god and then being rejected by them, she turns her powers against her romantic competition.

As a result, Zeus punishes Circe with banishment. In some ways she enjoys her solitude on the deserted island, she hones her craft and waits. During the novel, she encounters some of the most famous figures in mythology, such as the Minotaur, Daedalus and Icarus, Medea, and cunning Odysseus.

This is a story [of men and gods and wrath](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/john-gwynne-gods-malice-and-wrath), of power and revenge, and of love. Circe's story is an epic celebration of family rivalry, palace intrigue, and above all, the unbreakable strength of women in a world dominated by men. Circe is a triumph of storytelling and a must-read for fans of Greek mythology.

### 6. The Lion of Macedon by David Gemmel

Regular readers of this blog will know that no list is complete without an entry from one of my favourite authors, David Gemmel. He write a few [fantasy fiction](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/29-best-fantasy-books) books set in ancient Greece, with his Troy series, starting with [Lord of the Silver Bow](https://amzn.to/41sFZ8X), becoming highly acclaimed.

However, my favourite of his books set in ancient Greece is The Lion of Macedon. This novel follows the character of Parmenion from his birthplace in Sparta where he learns strategy from the famous Athenian and student of Socrates, [Xenophon](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/xenophon-life-and-philosophy). From there he travels to Thebes and finally to Macedonia where he meets Phillip of Macedon and lays the foundation for the conquest of Alexander the Great.

He’s a mighty warrior, an unbeatable strategist, and hated by the gods. Along the way, he leads Thebes to beat Sparta in a pitched battle of equal numbers for the first time ever, meets Aristotle, and travels to the underworld.

### 7. The Penelopiad by Margaret Atwood

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/c36fc14d-613e-48fb-824b-3a648011e5cd/the-penelopiad.jpg)

Margaret Atwood has returned with a witty and perceptive retelling of the myth of Odysseus, told from the perspective of Penelope. In the foreword, Atwood explains her decision to give Penelope and the twelve hanged maids the opportunity to tell the story.

The maids form a Chorus, singing and chanting, and questioning the events that led to their hanging and Penelope's true intentions. Atwood believes that the story as it is told in the Odyssey has too many inconsistencies, and she herself has always been troubled by the fate of the hanged maids. In The Penelopiad, Penelope is similarly haunted by their deaths.

### 8. Stone Blind by Natalie Haynes

Medusa, the youngest of the Gorgon sisters, is the only mortal in her family of gods. Unlike her siblings, Medusa ages, and experiences change and weakness. When the sea god Poseidon violates her in the temple of Athene, the goddess punishes Medusa instead of him, forever transforming her. Her hair is replaced by writhing snakes, and her gaze can turn any living creature to stone. Cursed with the power to destroy all she loves with one look, Medusa lives a life of solitude until Perseus embarks on a fateful quest to fetch the head of a Gorgon.

In Stone Blind, classicist and comedian Natalie Haynes turns our understanding of this legendary myth on its head by bringing empathy and nuance to Medusa's story. The novel delves into the origins of this mythic tale and reconstructs Medusa's story with passion and wit, offering a timely retelling of this classic myth that speaks to us today. The book challenges the portrayal of women as monsters, punished for the assault of powerful men, and brings a fresh perspective to one of the earliest stories of its kind.

### 9. Gods Behaving Badly by Marie Phillips

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/2e30e37c-74da-4fe6-8a3d-f0f3cb643d80/gods-behaving-badly.jpg)

The Greek gods of Olympus are still alive and kicking in the twenty-first century, but their current living situation in a cramped London townhouse is less than ideal. To make ends meet, they’ve had to take on day jobs, with Artemis working as a dog-walker, Apollo posing as a TV psychic, Aphrodite taking calls as a phone sex operator, and Dionysus spinning records as a DJ. To make matters worse, their powers are weakening, and even their favourite pastime of turning mortals into trees is draining their energy reserves.

As tensions rise between Aphrodite and Apollo, the conflict quickly escalates into a battle that puts the fate of humanity at risk. Caught in the middle of the chaos are Alice and Neil, two ordinary humans who must summon their own heroic qualities to save not only themselves but the world as well. In this hilarious and action-packed tale, author Marie Phillips puts a modern twist on ancient mythology and asks whether or not mere mortals can rise to the level of the gods.

### 10. Piranesi by Susanna Clarke

Piranesi's dwelling is no ordinary edifice. Its rooms are limitless, its corridors endless, and its walls adorned with countless statues, each unique from the others. Within the maze-like structure, an ocean is contained; waves crash up stairwells, rooms flood within moments. But Piranesi is unafraid; he comprehends the tides as he does the labyrinth's layout. He lives to explore the house.

Apart from Piranesi, there is just one other individual who frequents the house—a man referred to as The Other. He visits Piranesi twice a week to solicit aid with researching A Great and Secret Knowledge. Yet, as Piranesi ventures deeper, clues surface of another presence, and a ghastly reality starts to unravel, exposing a world beyond Piranesi's familiar realm.

Every seven years, the Agon begins, forcing nine Greek gods to walk the earth as mortals and be hunted by the descendants of ancient bloodlines, who seek to kill a god and take their divine power and immortality. Lore Perseous had fled this brutal world after her family was murdered by a rival line, turning away from the hunt's promise of eternal glory.

However, as the next hunt approaches in New York City, a childhood friend believed long dead, Castor, and a gravely wounded Athena, seek Lore's help. Athena proposes an alliance against their mutual enemy and a way for Lore to leave the Agon behind forever. But binding her fate to Athena's and rejoining the hunt will come at a deadly cost, and may not be enough to stop the rise of a new god with the power to bring humanity to its knees. The book is a tale of revenge, alliances, and sacrifices in a world of immortal gods and mortals.

### 14. Lore Olympus Series by Rachel Smythe

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/f58f8705-8eda-4c4b-a3ad-1d69eb0a8998/lore+olympus.jpeg)

The final item on this list is something a little different - a graphic novel.

Lore Olympus is a modernised retelling of the classic love story between two gods, Hades and Persephone. Originally a webcomic (which you can read on [the Webtoon app](https://www.webtoons.com/en/)) you can now get the first volume as a graphic novel. The beautiful artwork invites you into a world of scandal, parties, and forbidden love.

This contemporary reimagining of the Greek pantheon captures the all-too-human emotions of these all-powerful deities as they battle and bicker amongst themselves, commit terrifying acts of wrath against humanity and struggle with love and fear and jealousy.

One of the most exceptional aspects of this romantic and dazzlingly detailed graphic novel is the way creator Rachel Smythe deals with trauma and abuse, powerlessness and power.
