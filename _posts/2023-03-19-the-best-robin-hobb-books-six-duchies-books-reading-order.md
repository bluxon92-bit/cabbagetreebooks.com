Robin Hobb is a beloved author in the fantasy genre, known for her richly imagined worlds and [complex characters](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/how-to-write-believable-characters). One of her most significant contributions to the genre is the Farseer Trilogy. These books introduce readers to the realm of the Six Duchies and the character of FitzChivalry Farseer, and they’re personally my favourite of her work.

Since publishing the Farseer trilogy, Robin Hobb has published multiple series set in the same world, including the Liveship Traders Trilogy, the Tawny Man Trilogy, and the Fitz and the Fool Trilogy. In this article, we explore Robin Hobb’s Farseer Trilogy as well as her wider body of work, discussing the importance of reading order and the impact of her writing on [the fantasy genre](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/29-best-fantasy-books).

## The Farseer Trilogy: An Overview

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/84b65ca7-b612-4ff0-97fc-0b0387e09676/farseer+2+%281%29.jpeg)

The Farseer Trilogy is set in a world of magics that are both revered and feared, known and forgotten. The main character, FitzChivalry Farseer, is the bastard son of Prince Chivalry and is raised in the royal household of the Farseers.

However, this isn’t a fun story about a prince realising his destiny. Fitz is an outcast, despised by the courts for what he represents. He’s a child that’s manipulated and used by almost everyone around him.

As the name of the first book in the Farseer trilogy, Assassin’s Apprentice, suggests, he is apprenticed to the court assassin and regularly finds himself placed in dangerous scenarios as an expendable asset.

### Robin Hobb and Magic in the Six Duchies

On top of being the bastard son of the beloved Chivalry (a man who in all other things lives up to his name), Fitz is gifted with both the Skill and the Wit. The Skill is a powerful royal magic that allows long-distance telepathy, powerful illusions, and mental manipulation. Those who are practised in the Skill can force others to do their bidding, and even influence the real world.

The Wit (also known as "Old Blood") on the other hand, is a shunned magic, despised and feared. It allows people to telepathically to communicate and bond with animals. Fitz bonds with a young wolf who becomes his constant companion. However, within the Six Duchies legends have it that practitioners of the Wit slowly lose their humanity to become more animal than man.

The three books that make up the trilogy (Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin, and Assassin's Quest) are an epic journey of self-discovery, of [dragons](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/best-dragon-books), Elderlings, and ancient barely understood [magic](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/11-best-books-by-brandon-sanderson). A story of the underdog fighting against all the odds to save a world that hates and fears him.

Many of her books take place in the same world and feature [interconnected characters](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/how-to-create-a-character-profile) and storylines. Because of the interconnected nature of each of these series, whilst it’s not essential to read them in order it is recommended to start at the beginning with her first book Assassin’s Apprentice.

**Ship of Magic** (1998): The first book in the series introduces readers to the city of Bingtown, where a number of wealthy merchant families own sentient "liveships" made of magical wizardwood.

The Vestrit family is one such family, and they are preparing to launch their liveship, Vivacia, when the patriarch, Ephron Vestrit, suddenly dies. The family's finances are in dire straits and the launch of the liveship is critical to their future success. However, Vivacia's new captain has ulterior motives that put the Vestrits and their ship in danger.

## The Importance of Robin Hobb and The Farseer Trilogy in Fantasy Literature

The Farseer Trilogy is often cited as a game-changer in the [fantasy genre](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/fantasy-short-stories). It features a realistic and flawed protagonist who is not the typical hero found in epic fantasy. Fitz's struggles with his identity and place in the world make him a relatable and sympathetic character. Hobb's focus on character development and emotional depth set her writing apart from other fantasy authors.

The Farseer Trilogy also paved the way for other authors to explore the nuances of character and theme in their writing. It's no coincidence that the rise of [grimdark fantasy](https://bookriot.com/guide-to-grimdark-fantasy/), which focuses on darker and more morally ambiguous characters, coincided with the popularity of the Farseer Trilogy.

In conclusion, Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and subsequent works have left an indelible mark on the fantasy genre. Her vivid characters, intricate plots, and unparalleled world-building have captivated readers for decades.
