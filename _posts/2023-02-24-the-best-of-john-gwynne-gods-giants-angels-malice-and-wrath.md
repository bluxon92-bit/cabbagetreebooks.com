He’s been praised for his ability to create vivid and believable fantasy worlds that are populated by characters that readers care about.

In this article, we take a look at the best of John Gwynne’s books, the order of their publication and where you should start.

## In what order should I read John Gwynne’s books?

John Gwynne’s first book to be published was Malice was in 2012. Since that time he’s reliably published one book a year. So, where should you start?

Each of the series by John Gwynne stands independent of the other, meaning you don’t need to read The Faithful and the Fallen Series before the Bloodsworn Saga. However, when starting a new series you want to start at the beginning - so really there are 3 books you want to be considering.

1.   Malice, the first book in The Faithful and the Fallen series.
2.   A Time of Dread, the first book in the Blood & Bone series.
3.   The Shadow of the Gods, the first book in The Bloodsworn Saga.

For my part, I would recommend The Shadow of the Gods as your first stop - simply because it’s my favourite. However, the Bloodsworn Saga is not yet finished - though, if his publishing pattern to date is any indication we can expect the third instalment sometime during 2023. If you’re looking for a completed series you can sit down and devour from end to end, then start with Malice from The Faithful and the Fallen.

The story is filled with monsters, warbands and powered humans tainted by their divine ancestors.

The first book, The Shadow of the Gods, follows in the footsteps of three people: a huntress on a dangerous quest, a noblewoman who has rejected privilege in pursuit of battle fame, and a thrall who seeks vengeance among the famed mercenaries known as the Bloodsworn. All three will shape the fate of the world as it once more falls under the shadow of the gods

## About The Faithful and the Fallen Series by John Gwynne

### Malice by John Gwynne (2012)

Malice by John Gwynne is set in [a broken world](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/9-dystopian-novels-to-read). The Banished Lands, is a place of violence where men and giants battle, and the earth remembers their blood. Now, monsters stir, and those who can still read the signs see a danger far worse than all that has come before.

Some of the main characters include Corban, Evnis, Veradis, and Nathair. Corban has grand ideals of heroism. He wants to be a warrior, to protect and serve. But bloodshed is rarely heroic. Evnis wants the power to rule, a power that will soon be in his grasp, and he will do anything to get it. Veradis one of the most skilled swordsmen to have ever lived exists in his brother's shadow. Prince Nathair has plans, but these plans largely don’t involve his father the High King, in fact, they largely disagree with him.

### Valor by John Gwynne	(2014)

Valor by John Gwynne is the immediate follow-on to Malice and is a non-stop action novel with excellent pacing, unexpected twists, and high stake battles.

It continues to follow the same characters including Corban, Nathair and Veradis. Corban and his friends must flee north after their home of Dun Crin is invaded, leaving the whole fortress in chaos. The journey will be a challenging one as they find themselves in enemy territory and a Warband ambitiously hunting them.

It also continues Nathair’s storyline, who fresh from victories in Arcona, have launched a holy crusade in the Banished Lands and are challenging any who opposes him. Veradis, Nathair’s first sword, is fiercely loyal to the crusade efforts and Nathairs command but starts to question the moral implications surrounding the expedition.

Gwynne also now introduces several new characters. First is, Fidele, mother to Nathair, as she deals with the turmoil surrounding the death of her husband the High King. Maquin dreams of revenge, but if he wants to survive slavery he must first fight his way out of the pits. Finally, we have Lykos, king of the three southern isles.

### Ruin by John Gwynne (2015)

The third in The Faithful and the Fallen series, Ruin by John Gwynne continues the gripping battle of good vs evil.

The Banished Lands are now fully engulfed in war and chaos. The cunning Queen Rhin has conquered the west and High King Nathair has the cauldron, the most powerful of the seven treasures. At his back stands the scheming Calidus and a Warband of the Kadoshim, dread demons of the Otherworld. They plan to bring Asroth and his host of the Fallen into the world of flesh, but to do so they need the seven treasures.

Nathair has been deceived but now he knows the truth. He has choices to make; choices that will determine the fate of the Banished Lands. Corban must finally stop running and face his fate head-on and Maquin is finally loose but hunted by Lykos and his corsairs.

### Wrath by John Gwynne (2016)

The fourth instalment in The Faithful and the Fallen series, Wrath by John Gwynne is the breathtaking, pulse-pounding conclusion to the epic series.

The war reaches new heights with the characters finally realising their destinies. Rebellion and bloodshed have paved the way, but Nathair is close to opening the portal to the Otherworld to allow Asroth and his demon-horde into the Banished Lands and finally become flesh.

Corban must make new allies to survive, and somehow counter the threat Nathair represents. His life hangs in the balance – and with it, the fate of the Banished Lands. Truth, courage and loyalty will be tested as never before.

### The Shadow of the Gods by John Gwynne (2021)

After the gods warred and drove themselves to extinction, the cataclysm of their fall shattered the land of Vigrið.

Now a new world is rising, where power-hungry jarls feud and monsters stalk the woods and mountains. A world where the bones of the dead gods still hold great power for those brave – or desperate – enough to seek them out.

Now, as whispers of war echo across the mountains and fjords, fate follows in the footsteps of three people: a huntress on a dangerous quest, a noblewoman who has rejected privilege in pursuit of battle fame, and a thrall who seeks vengeance among the famed mercenaries known as the Bloodsworn.

All three will shape the world's fate as it once more falls under the shadow of the gods.

### The Hunger of the Gods by John Gwynne (2022)

Lik-Rifa, the dragon god of legend, has been freed from her eternal prison. Now she plots a new age of blood and conquest.

As Orka continues the hunt for her missing son, the Bloodsworn sweep south in a desperate race to save one of their own – and Varg takes the first steps on the path of vengeance.

Elvar has sworn to fulfil her blood oath and rescue a prisoner from the clutches of Lik-Rifa and her Dragonborn followers, but first, she must persuade the Battle-Grim to follow her.

Yet even the might of the Bloodsworn and Battle-Grim cannot stand alone against a dragon god.

Their hope lies within the mad writings of a chained god. A book of forbidden magic with the power to raise the wolf god Ulfrir from the dead and bring about a battle that will shake the foundations of the earth.

### Is the Bloodsworn Saga set in the same universe as the Faithful and the Fallen?

Unlike the Blood & Bones books and the Faithful and the fallen series which are set in the Banished Lands, the Bloodsworn Saga explores a new, Norse-inspired world, with dead gods and monsters.

Here, the dread dragon god, Lik-Rifa the soul-stealer, shall be released from her ancient tomb to threaten all of Vigrid and usher in a new era of blood, death and conquest. Humanity must face Tainted warriors, the dragon-born, terrible monsters and a cult of followers, all slaved to her will.

### How many books are there in the Bloodsworn Saga?

There are currently two books in the Bloodsworn saga with the third expected to be published later in 2023.
