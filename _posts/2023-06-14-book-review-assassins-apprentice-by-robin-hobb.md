Robin Hobb’s Assassin’s Apprentice is an old favourite of mine that I fell in love with as a teen and have revisited more than once, most recently when I was writing up the article [***The Best Robin Hobb Books: Six Duchies Books Reading Order***](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/robin-hobb-farseer-and-beyond)***. ***Robin Hobb weaves an impressive [Grimdark](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/grimdark-fantasy-books) tale where the protagonist must overcome impossible odds with the deck always stacked against him.

The first book in the Farseer trilogy, Assassin's Apprentice, follows the journey of Fitz, an abandoned orphan who rises from obscurity to earn respect and become a figure others look up to. In this debut novel, we are introduced to the world, witness Fitz's struggles, and encounter some of the remarkable characters who will populate the pages of its sequels. Hobb's talent shines through, not just in storytelling but also in her writing.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/42qRInW)

## Assassin’s Apprentice Plot - 4/5

[Assassin's Apprentice](https://amzn.to/42qRInW) tells the story of Fitz-Chivalry. Fitz is abandoned on the doorstep of royalty and informed that he’s the bastard son of Prince Chivalry Farseer. He’s entrusted to the head f the stables, a man called Burrich, who becomes a father figure to him, teaching him right from wrong.

As Fitz grows older, he faces challenges due to being a bastard, encountering bullying, and powerful enemies. He struggles to fit into society and grows up lonely. However, during this period he discovers he has the Wit, an ancient and shunned magic that allows him to communicate with animals and he forms an enduring friendship and bond with a young wolf pup.

While Assassin's Apprentice may not possess the high [fantasy](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/29-best-fantasy-books) elements found in some other novels, the magic system is one I love. The Skill is based on mental experience and the Wit allows the user to bond with animals. Additionally, while there are no accounts of super mythological creatures in this first book, there are allusions to [dragons](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/best-dragon-books) which come into later books in the series.

The pacing and writing in this novel are superb. The story doesn't rush along, yet it is narrated in a compelling manner that invests readers in the characters and the narrative. Despite being Hobb's debut novel, Assassin's Apprentice demonstrates a remarkable level of maturity and thoughtful execution.

The only reason that it doesn’t get five stars is that it’s the later books in the Farseer trilogy (and actually in the overall Elderlings series as Hobbs develops her [world-building](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/15-steps-to-fantasy-world-building)) that really show Hobb’s true plotting abilities.

## Assassin’s Apprentice Characters - 5/5

The reason for this storie’s success is its remarkable characters. Fitz himself is obviously superbly executed, but so are the rest. Perhaps my favourite secondary character is Burrich - the taciturn and grumpy stablehand who, though unsure of his role and with no intention of becoming a father figure, does so. Burrich, despite his best efforts finds himself caring for Fitz more deeply than he anticipated. He loses his temper when Fitz is careless, fears for his safety, and understands the need to comfort him despite not being one to display deep emotions. Burrich is a brilliant character and definitely one of my favourites.

Fitz, the main character, and the story is told from his perspective, allowing readers insight into his thoughts and perspectives. He may not possess the most charismatic personality, but his character arc is phenomenal. He evolves from a quiet and timid boy into a courageous and confident young man who dares to speak to princes and challenge his superiors.

Then there are the villains. Some you identify straight away, and others are surprises, so I won't name names. However, their intentions become evident early on, and they grow increasingly spiteful. Fitz's status as a bastard prince incites envy and dislike among some characters. You'll despise these characters and their continuous successes will have you ready to climb into the pages and physically attack them.

## Overall Rating of Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb - 4.5/5

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnkddcxrt/image/upload/sq_images/farseer-2-1-.jpeg)

I was inclined to give [Assassin's Apprentice](https://amzn.to/42qRInW) five stars, but I actually think the rest of the series gets even better.

Nevertheless, it remains a fantastically written and highly intriguing first book in a new fantasy series for me, with sequels that surpass it and I highly recommend you explore the entire series, if not [embark on a full journey into the realm of the Elderlings](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/robin-hobb-farseer-and-beyond).
