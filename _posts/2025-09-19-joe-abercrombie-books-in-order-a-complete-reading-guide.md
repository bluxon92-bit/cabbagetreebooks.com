*No one writes fantasy quite like Joe Abercrombie. Brutal, brilliant, and laugh-out-loud cruel. His books hit so hard you almost want to cry.*

I’ve just finished his *First Law* trilogy and, honestly, I need more. So, I thought, what better excuse to dive headfirst into his best work and the recommended reading order?

If you’re new to Abercrombie, well — put your socks on and buckle in. These are not the kind of stories you’ll find in classics penned by [David Gemmell](/blog/david-gemmells-drenai-series), Robert Jordan, or Eddings, where flawed heroes are still, at heart, good. In Abercrombie’s world, the characters are broken, brutal, and often downright awful. Some may mean well, but the darkness and grit of the [world-building](/writers-blog/15-steps-to-fantasy-world-building) leave little room for noble intentions. Those who rise tend to be the worst of the worst, and no good deed goes unpunished.

It can be exhausting — you desperately want good to prevail, and sometimes it even looks like it might… until the only halfway competent character suddenly vomits all over the tent and keels over dead.

So, whether you’re new or back for another round of punishment, here’s a guide to Abercrombie’s novels in order, with a quick synopsis of each.

## The First Law Trilogy

Here’s my take on the trilogy that’s got me hooked.

### 1. The Blade Itself

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/d9a959f2-c515-46d7-91de-80404041fa91/blade+itself+abercrombie.jpg)

This opener pulled me in straight away, not with noble heroes or epic quests, but with a gang of misfits I wasn’t sure I should even be rooting for.

Logen Ninefingers is both terrifying and oddly likeable, Jezal is so insufferable you kind of want to slap him, Bayaz appears at first noble and wise, a Gandalf-esque character you think — but, well then he explodes a man for making him angry, and Glokta… well, he might be the most compelling torturer I’ve ever read.

Abercrombie doesn’t ease you in gently, he throws you into the mud, laughs while you scramble, and somehow makes it all addictive.

### 2. Before They Are Hanged

This book is where the whole world really started to open up for me. The stakes feel bigger, nastier, and far more unpredictable.

Glokta is given an impossible mission in Dagoska—where his chances of survival are, well, none. You watch him manoeuvre with a wit as nimble as his body is broken.

Meanwhile, the “quest” with Bayaz and the crew could have been cliché, six characters in a Fellowship-style adventure to the edge of the world… but Abercrombie twists it into something messy and uncomfortable. It’s less about magic artifacts and macguffins, and more about exposing just how fragile these characters are.

And in the North, somehow the Union’s generals manage to maintain their arrogance and foolishness, even as Bethod and his army of Northmen flank, surprise, and utterly annihilate whole sections of their army.

### 3. Last Argument of Kings

The finale, every thread from the previous books comes crashing together, but not in the neat, triumphant way most fantasy fans might hope for.

Characters who looked like they were headed for redemption spiral instead; victories taste bitter; and just when you think someone might catch a break, Abercrombie yanks it away. I don’t think I’ve ever read an ending so bleak and yet so *right*. It left me both exhausted and desperate for more.

## First Law Standalone Novels

I haven’t reached these yet, but they’re next on my hit list. Each is set in the same world as the *First Law* trilogy, but they can be read independently. Here’s what you can expect.

### 4. Best Served Cold

Set three years after the original trilogy’s events, this standalone revenge epic centers on Monza Murcatto—a formidable mercenary betrayed by her employer, Duke Orso. Left for dead after a vicious ambush that costs her both limb and honor, Monza embarks on a relentless quest for vengeance.

Gathering an unlikely band of misfits—including a cold-blooded Northman, a poisoner with a flair for dramatic theatrics, and an ex-inquisitor—the novel is a non-stop bloodbath of betrayal, retribution, and dark humor. Every character in her crew struggles with their own moral ambiguities, making this a tale where even the act of revenge is not black and white.

### 5. The Heroes

Fast forward several years and the narrative shifts to the chaos of war—a three-day, blood-soaked battle between the Union and the northern barbarians.

Told from multiple points of view, including a battle-worn veteran determined to salvage honor, a scheming noble with dangerous ambitions, and a disillusioned soldier forced to confront his mortality, *The Heroes* captures the raw, unfiltered brutality of combat. Amid savage clashes and shifting alliances, Abercrombie masterfully portrays how war can both forge and shatter the human spirit.

### 6. Red Country

Blending the aesthetics of a Western with Abercrombie’s trademark grimdark style, *Red Country* follows Shy South on a desperate quest to rescue her kidnapped siblings. Accompanied by her hesitant stepfather and a reluctant rogue, Shy journeys across unforgiving frontiers—through scorched outposts, lawless towns gripped by gold fever, and into the remoteness of uncharted mountains. Here, the past refuses to remain buried, and redemption must be won through a relentless fight against both external enemies and internal demons.

## Short Stories

These stories expand on the world and characters I already know offering tantalizing vignettes from across the First Law world. I’m saving this one for when I need a quick fix of Abercrombie’s grit.

### 7. Sharp Ends

Ranging from gruesome tales of Inquisitor Glokta’s earlier exploits to previously untold adventures featuring both major and minor characters, *Sharp Ends* enriches the larger saga with its blend of dark humor, savage action, and poignant character moments.

Whether you’re revisiting familiar faces or discovering new perspectives, each story in this anthology adds a unique stitch to the complex fabric of Abercrombie’s universe.

## The Age of Madness Trilogy

Thirty years later, the world moves on, but in true Abercrombie fashion, it doesn’t necessarily move forward. I haven’t cracked these open yet, but the themes of industrial upheaval and revolution sound like Abercrombie at his sharpest.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/2d4f27d1-8d13-4e19-a783-936fef89ce1c/a+little+hatred+abercrombie.jpg)

### 8. A Little Hatred

*A Little Hatred* marks a new era in the First Law world as the old order crumbles beneath the weight of industrial revolution and social upheaval. Set roughly 30 years after the events of the original trilogy, this book follows a fresh cast of characters—including ambitious heirs, hardened soldiers, and cunning social climbers—who navigate the treacherous landscape of change.

Ancient magics clash with modern ambitions and the collision of past and present creates a tense environment where every act of violence or kindness echoes into the future.

### 9. The Trouble With Peace

In a world where peace is nothing but a tenuous illusion, *The Trouble With Peace* delves into the political machinations and personal betrayals that thrive after conflict. Familiar figures like Savine dan Glokta and Leo dan Brock find themselves grappling with their conflicting desires for stability and power, even as the fragile ceasefire between warring factions begins to crack.

This instalment is steeped in political intrigue and moral compromise, illustrating that, in Abercrombie’s universe, true peace is as elusive as it is dangerous.

### 10. The Wisdom of Crowds

The climactic finale of the Age of Madness trilogy, *The Wisdom of Crowds* thrusts readers into a maelstrom of revolution and ancient magic. With society teetering on the brink of complete collapse, characters on both sides of the spectrum—ranging from embattled royalty to desperate commoners—must confront the chaotic consequences of radical change.

This novel challenges the very nature of power and legacy. Abercrombie’s incisive wit and brutal realism shine through, leaving you to ponder whether salvation comes at the price of eternal sacrifice.

## The Shattered Sea Trilogy (Young Adult)

Different audience, same edge. This trilogy is technically YA, but from what I’ve read about it so far, it doesn’t pull too many punches. Another one I’ll be picking up down the line.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/8f58a89e-b630-4590-9f73-d81dd82f601a/half+teh+world+abercrombie.jpg)

### Half a King

*Half a King* introduces Yarvi, the underestimated younger son of a proud Gettland king, who is born with a deformed hand and thus deemed unworthy in his war-torn society. When tragedy strikes—sparing him from the life he never wanted—Yarvi is forced into a reluctant ascent to leadership.

Betrayal, slavery, and a brutal struggle for survival pave his path, as he learns that ingenuity and resolve can outweigh physical might. This coming-of-age tale is both a harsh lesson in personal resilience and the spark that ignites the epic saga of the Shattered Sea.

### Half the World

In the second entry of the Shattered Sea series, the narrative shifts to a more expansive perspective with two new protagonists: Thorn Bathu, a fierce 16-year-old warrior determined to avenge her father’s death, and Brand, a conflicted fighter seeking redemption.

As they join Yarvi’s ragtag crew on a perilous maritime quest to forge alliances against a tyrannical High King, they discover that the cost of ambition and revenge is measured in blood and sacrifice. Their journey across turbulent seas and hostile lands challenges their beliefs and molds them into the heroes they never imagined they could become.

### Half a War

The tumultuous conclusion to the Shattered Sea trilogy, *Half a War* raises the stakes to unprecedented heights. War erupts on a massive scale, pulling Yarvi’s band of unlikely heroes into a full-scale conflict where every strategy is put to the test.

Alliances shatter and new foes arise, the characters must navigate treacherous battlefields where survival depends on both cunning intellect and deadly combat. In a world where every victory is stained with loss, *Half a War* brings Yarvi’s epic journey to a heart-pounding close—and asks whether revenge and redemption can truly coexist.

## Final Thoughts: Joe Abercrombie Books In Order

I’ve only scratched the surface with the *First Law* trilogy, but it’s already clear why Abercrombie has the reputation he does. His universe is vast, brutal, and unforgettably human—a tapestry woven with dark threads of political intrigue, raw violence, and deeply flawed characters.

Whether you’re starting with the trilogy, dipping into the revenge-fueled standalones, or exploring the Age of Madness, every book promises more of the grit and genius that made me desperate to keep reading. And if you’re ahead of me, well—I’ll catch up soon enough.
