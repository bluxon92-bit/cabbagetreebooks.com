Isaac Asimov is one of my favourite [science fiction authors](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/10-sci-fi-authors) alongside the likes of [Arthur C Clarke](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/the-city-and-the-stars-arthur-c-clarke) and Ursula K Le Guin. He’s best known for his Foundation and Robot series. But, he was a prolific author writing or editing over 500 books over his career and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards.

He was more than just a prolific science fiction writer though, he was a biochemist, science writer, a humanist, a rationalist, and a lover of liberty, regularly speaking out on behalf of freedom of thought and expression.

Much of [Isaac Asimov’s work](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/best-isaac-asimov-books) hinged on a ceaselessly speculative curiosity as he sought to answer the question “what if?” What if we developed intelligent androids? What if humanity colonised the stars?

Isaac Asimov died in 1992, but he left behind a legacy filled with a keen understanding of what it means to be human and the importance of hope for the future. In this article, we take a look at some of Isaac Asimov’s most influential quotes.

## Here’s a list of Isaac Asimov’s most influential quotes

## Final Words

Isaac Asimov is a must-read for sci-fi lovers. His books and essay cover a comprehensive array of topics. He was a great believer in the scientific method, the importance of healthy scepticism and empirical evidence. But, his work also highlights the [dangers of technology](https://dyopath.com/eight-negative-impacts-of-technology/) and the challenges it brings even as it makes our lives easier.
