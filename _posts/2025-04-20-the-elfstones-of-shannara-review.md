Here's a debate that runs through the Shannara fandom with the energy of a theological dispute: do you start with *The Sword of Shannara* (the first book, heavily influenced by Tolkien, and by general consensus the weakest of the early novels), or do you skip straight to *The Elfstones of Shannara* (the second book, universally agreed to be where Brooks found his own voice)?

I'm in the skip-to-Elfstones camp, and I'll explain why.

---

## Some Context

Terry Brooks published *The Sword of Shannara* in 1977 — one of the earliest epic fantasy novels not written by Tolkien or his contemporaries. It was enormously successful and almost as enormously derivative; Tolkien's influence is present on every page, and not always comfortably so.

*The Elfstones of Shannara*, published in 1982, is a different book. It uses the same world and some overlapping characters, but it reads as if Brooks had five years to figure out what *he* wanted to say rather than what he wanted to echo. The result is the novel that's kept his series in print across five decades.

## What's It About?

An ancient magical barrier called the Ellcrys — a silver tree that seals away the Forbidding, a prison dimension where demons have been confined since the dawn of the world — is dying. If it dies, the Forbidding fails, and the demons come through.

The only way to restore the Ellcrys is to find its seed and carry it to a place called the Bloodfire. The task falls to a young Elf woman named Amberle — granddaughter of the Elven king — and Wil Ohmsford, a young man with uncertain control of the Elfstones, the powerful magical artefacts of the title.

They travel through a world that has been crumbling since *The Sword of Shannara*'s events, with a demon called the Dagda Mor sending his forces ahead of them, and a shape-shifting Changeling assassin hunting them directly.

---

## What Works

The premise is effectively done. Brooks creates genuine urgency — the Ellcrys is failing, time is short, the consequences of failure are existential — and he sustains it across the novel without the momentum flagging. For a book published in 1982 about a mission to save the world from demons, it holds up remarkably well.

Amberle is the standout character. She's complicated in ways that female protagonists in fantasy rarely were in 1982 — conflicted about her duty, genuinely frightened, carrying a secret that shapes the novel's ending in devastating fashion. The novel belongs to her.

The Reaper — the demon sent specifically to kill Wil and Amberle — is one of the great fantasy monsters of its era. Relentless, terrifying, and used sparingly enough to remain frightening throughout.

The ending is genuinely moving. I won't spoil it, but it's the reason *The Elfstones of Shannara* has endured when many of its contemporaries haven't.

---

## What Doesn't Quite Work

The prose is functional fantasy writing of its era — adequate, occasionally clunky, never beautiful. If you're coming to this from Rothfuss or Hobb, the quality drop on a sentence level is noticeable.

Wil is a less interesting protagonist than Amberle and spends much of the novel slightly overshadowed by her. He's fine. She's great.

## Do You Need to Read The Sword of Shannara First?

No. *The Elfstones of Shannara* is a sequel in the loosest sense — it shares a world and the Ohmsford family name — but it stands completely alone. I'd start here, and if you love it, the [Terry Brooks reading guide](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/terry-brooks-books-in-order) covers where to go next.
