From gripping tales of ancient civilisations to [epic sagas ](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/john-gwynne-gods-malice-and-wrath)set against the backdrop of world-changing events, historical fiction authors have shaped literary landscapes.

In this article, we’ve collated a list of the best historical fiction authors. So, whether you seek battles and conquests, romance and intrigue, or nuanced explorations of the human condition, these authors are the custodians of captivating narratives that will leave an indelible mark on your literary journey.

## What is historical fiction?

Historical fiction is a genre that blends elements of history with fictional storytelling. It involves creating narratives that are set in the past, often featuring actual historical events, settings, or figures. However, it’s important to note that while historical fiction incorporates factual elements, the story itself is fictional, with characters and plots created by the author.

The best historical fiction will be the product of extensive research and offer an accurate portrayal of the historical context, including social customs, political climates, and technological advancements of the time period. As such, this genre allows readers to immerse themselves in different eras and gain insights into the lives and experiences of people from the past.

There are no guidelines for authors regarding what they can and can’t write about or which historical events they should feature. For example, historical fiction [books set in ancient Greece](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/best-books-about-greek-mythology) are popular right now. Some of my favourite historical fiction novels though are set in more obscure places and time periods allowing me to learn something new.

This unique blend of education and entertainment allows authors to explore lesser-known aspects of history or present alternative perspectives on well-known events.

## What makes a great historical fiction book?

Several factors contribute to making a great historical fiction book including:

**Authenticity and Research:** When I read a historical fiction book I want to come away feeling like I was there. I want to take away a new understanding of how the world worked in this place and time. As such, a great historical fiction book is grounded in thorough research and attention to detail, this helps readers visualise and understand the historical context.

**Compelling Characters:** Having a great setting for your story isn’t enough. We ultimately [read stories for the characters](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/how-to-write-believable-characters). They should be multi-dimensional and we need to care about what happens to them.

**Well-Crafted Plot:** The plot should be driven by both historical events and the character’s personal journey. Balancing historical accuracy with an intriguing narrative arc, including conflicts, tensions, and resolutions, is essential in creating a page-turning experience.

**Themes and Relevance:** The best historical fiction tells timeless tales that explore the human condition. Often this means addressing universal issues such as love, power, identity, justice, or social change. By connecting the historical context to contemporary relevance, the book can offer insights, reflections, and commentary that extend beyond the specific time period.

Ultimately, a great historical fiction book seamlessly weaves together history and fiction, creating a captivating and immersive experience that educates, entertains, and resonates with readers.
