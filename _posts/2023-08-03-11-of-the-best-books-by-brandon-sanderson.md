Brandon Sanderson is one of the best-selling fantasy authors of our time. With a massive collection of excellent stories under his belt. However, this prolific collection of stories can also be a bit overwhelming. When an author has written and published over fifty books it can be hard to know where to start.

[Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com) is known for his fast-paced plots and unique magic systems, and the majority of them unfold in his Cosmere, a shared universe where a mysterious being called Adonalsium is killed by sixteen conspirators, and its powers shattered into sixteen shards. While the stories are kept largely separate, they exhibit some common elements that the more die-hard fans will be able to pick out.

With that being said, while some, like the Stormlight Archive, are vast and sprawling multi-volume series, many of the novels are excellent stand-alone fantasy books - so, where do you start? In this article, we take a look at 11 of the best Brandon Sanderson books to help guide you on the next step in your journey exploring this fantastic fantasy author.

## 11 Best Brandon Sanderson Books

### 1. Elantris

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/9256b028-6259-4ab7-933d-7215e211c8c9/elantris+cover+%281%29.jpg)

This was Sanderson’s debut novel and the first book by Brandon Sanderson that I read. It’s a standalone epic fantasy that is a more approachable length than many of his other books.

The plot revolves around the mystical city of Elantris and the immortal occupants the Elantrians. Elantrians are almost gods, selected and raised up to immortal status by a mysterious and magical transformation called the Shaod. They have an enhanced appearance and are capable of incredible feats of magic.

However, a tragedy strikes, the immortals fall from grace and the Shaod turns from a blessing into a curse. The protagonists must battle against the clock to uncover the mystery of this change before it’s too late.

[**Rated 4.8 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/3MPIk9q)

### 2. Warbreaker

Warbreaker is a story that follows a young princess who is betrothed and sent to be married to the hostile God-king of a neighbouring nation. To save her from her fate the princess’s sister sets out on a quest to bring her home. But, things quickly become more complicated as the two become caught up in a conspiracy for power.

This story involves a mysterious man who can use breath — magical energy that turns people into superhumans — and wields a talking and somewhat naive sword.

[**Rated 4.6 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/3LbiaN6)

### 3. Steelheart

Set in a world where a cosmic entity known as Calamity appears and a selection of the population is turned into “Epics” - superpowered humans that can defy the very laws of nature. However, superpowers don’t necessarily mean super-good.

Governments collapse in the face of this new power and the Epics become the rulers of the new order. Now, one regular man, is out to stop them.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/3oiNNex)

### 4. Arcanum Unbounded

Arcanum Unbounded is a collection of nine [fantasy short stories](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/fantasy-short-stories). These stories will give you a sense of Sanderson's voice and style and are a great starting point for people not yet ready to dive into his larger epics.

[**Rated 4.7 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/41WHdcv)

### 5. White Sand

White Sand is a graphic novel (Sandersons only one to date) and follows a group of people who can manipulate the sands around them. However, the group are suddenly attacked, leaving only one survivor (or so he thinks), named Kenton. With unknown enemies and dark conspiracies circling him, he must find allies and do everything he can to survive.

[**Rated 4.3 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/40kI8Sz)

### 6. Legion

Legion is a novella in which Brandon Sanderson explores a unique character, Stephen Leeds. Thought by some to be insane but known by most to be a genius, Stephen Leeds has multiple personalities - a legion of them. As the story begins Leeds is drawn into the search for the missing Balubal Razon, the inventor of an impossible camera that seems to be able to take pictures of the past.

Legion is one of Sanderson’s first explorations into mental illness in his characters. Something that in his Stormlight Archive he develops and explores more fully and sensitively in several of his protagonists.

### 7. The Rithmatist

Rithmatics is a type of magic that can be wielded through chalk and geometric shapes. It is largely used to combat monsters called the Chalkings. This story follows a character named Joel, a young man who dreams of being a Rithmatist but can only watch in envy as others master the magic. However, when students begin disappearing Joel is drawn into the mystery and discovers something that will change the world forever.

[**Rated 4.6 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/3Ab8pbs)

### 8. Skyward

Skyward diverges from Sanderson’s usual fantasy approach with a [sci-fi](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/12-classic-science-fiction-short-stories-you-need-to-read) twist.

The remnants of the human race have been defeated, crushed and chased across the stars. They are now trapped on a planet that is constantly harried and attacked by mysterious alien starfighters.

This story follows Spensa, a teenage girl that longs to be a pilot, longs to battle the aliens. When she discovers the ancient wreckage of a ship she realises that this dream might very well be possible - that is if she can repair it, navigate flight school and (perhaps most importantly) persuade the ship to help her. Because this ship is different, it appears to have a soul.

### 9. Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians

Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians is a story for younger audiences or people looking for a fun quick read and is filled with wit and hysterical “talents”.

This story follows Alcatraz Smedry, a young boy who on his thirteenth birthday receives a strange gift from his parents, a bag of sand. Of course, it’s no ordinary sand, and it is quickly stolen by an evil cult. Alcatraz must stop them before they take over the world, but the only “talent” he has is breaking things.

### 10. Mistborn: The Final Empire (Book 1 of the Mistborn Series)

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/8df52a8c-7914-46a4-8476-f1bd85049ad3/mistbonr+1.jpg)

The Mistborn trilogy is a great place for fantasy lovers to start with Brandon Sanderson. It has a fleshed-out world, and an incredible magic system called Allomancy, where the snapped can ‘burn’ metals for various magical properties. Plus, even though it’s truly epic in scale with three heavy volumes, it’s a fast and compelling reading that will drag you to the finale.

A thousand years ago there was a prophecy. And so a hero set out on a quest to save the world. But that’s where the cliches end. Because **the hero of prophecy lost**.

Now, the Lord Ruler has dominated for a thousand years creating a world of injustice and hate, a world covered in ash, colourless and filled with monsters that do his bidding.

When one of the oppressed “snaps” and realises he has powers, he rises to the challenge, gathers a team and plots to overthrow the immortal god-king. As the trilogy unfolds, the plot twists and thickens. What started our as a heist develops into a full rebellion, and our small group of heroes find themselves in way over their heads.

### 11. The Way of Kings (Book 1 of the Stormlight Archives)

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61dd3a4e102f883537ae2f1d/1667859358012-PUL9K2W0EJEIIK5R731A/Brandon+sanderson+books+%281%29.jpeg)

The Way of Kings is Sanderson’s most ambitious series to date. A decade of planning and writing brings a rich world, a compelling narrative, and engaging characters.

The Knights Radiant have been gone from the world for centuries, but they left their mystical swords and armour (shards) behind. Men using these artefacts turn into near-invincible warriors and wars have been won and lost because of them. When King Gavilar is assassinated, the powerful kingdom of Alethkar, armed with more shards than anyone else, marches against the Parshendi in a war of retribution. The Parshendi a strange off-shoot of the Alethi slaves known as Parshmen, aren’t human. And the war on the shattered plains drags on for years.

The story follows Kaladin, a soldier-turned-slave who has grown bitter and angry at the carelessness of leaders who seem happy to throw away the lives of anyone they see as lesser than them. And Shallan, a young female scholar who hopes to save her family from ruin. The two find themselves at the centre of an upcoming catastrophe and must bring a return to the Knights Radiant and the old magics or risk humanity facing total destruction.

The Way of Kings is a masterclass in originality. This epic fast-paced series is truly vast in scope with an incredibly well-developed magic system (as you’d expect from Brandon Sanderson), with a unique and detailed world that completely reimagines every from insects to seasons.

## Which is Better: The Mistborn Series or Stormlight Archives?

Ultimately, whether you prefer the Mistborn series or Stormligt Archives comes down to personal preference. Both series are gripping page-turners with compelling characters. To give you an idea of what I mean, I finished the first book in the Stormlight series, a vast 1,000 page epic, in less than a week.

The Stormlight Archives’ [world-building](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/15-steps-to-fantasy-world-building) is richer and more detailed. With thousands of years of history, highly original and disparate customs and cultures unique to specific geographic locations. Even the eco-systems are carefully thought out with plants and animals with hard carapaces designed to survive the terrifying high storms.

The Mistborn series also features original elements from the ash that rains from the skies, to the integrated magic system of Allomancy. They both feature strong female and male protagonists with epic heart-pounding fight scenes.

If I really had to choose which of the Mistborn series or Stormlight Archives was better, I’d have to say The Stormlight Archives because of the detail and care. Sanderson has thought out every possible aspect of the world, its history, gods, animals and people. He’s invested years into getting this right, and it shows. There’s also a depth and darkness to the protagonists, Kaladin and Shallan, both of whom have suffered terrible past abuses, that gives them a more compelling edge.

## The Best of Brandon Sanderson: Where To Start?

If you’re looking for a standalone fantasy novel and a good introduction to Sanderson’s work, go with his first novel, Elantris. If you’re a fan of Sci-fi you might start with something like Skyward. Or if you’re more interested in something shorter, a psychological thriller like Legion may be for you.

For lovers of epic fantasies though, you might want to start with either The Way of Kings or Mistborn. As discussed above both are great reads, though with the caveat, that The Mistborn series is a little easier, a little more compact (though by no means short), and maybe a more suitable option as an introduction - The Stormlight Archives embarking on a sprawling and truly vast narrative.
