If you're a fan of [books about Greek mythology](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/best-books-about-greek-mythology) you’ve likely come across [Madeline Miller](http://madelinemiller.com) and her two novels, The Song of Achilles, and [Circe](https://amzn.to/431yiXm). [The Song of Achilles](https://amzn.to/42TtG5h) is Miller's is her debut novel and delves into the story of Achilles and Patroclus, tracing their journey from childhood to adulthood and the divergent paths they take despite their profound love for each other.

Miller, with her MA and BA in Ancient Greek, showcases a profound knowledge of the subject matter in this story. And adds a subtle twist to the tale: What if Achilles and Patroclus shared a bond that transcended mere friendship?

[The Song of Achilles](https://amzn.to/42TtG5h) unfolds through the first-person perspective of Patroclus, a prince born to a tyrannical king who is later banished from his kingdom after a fateful encounter. Exiled to the same kingdom where Achilles resides, Patroclus discovers that there is much more to Achilles than his [god-like abilities](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/john-gwynne-gods-malice-and-wrath) and attributes. Beneath the surface, Achilles is kind, compassionate, and morally upright. However, as they mature, Achilles must embrace his destined path as a hero. And Patroclus, insignificant in the eyes of many, must conceal their relationship while also navigating his own journey.

I really loved the plot of The Song of Achilles. And I’ve come to adore Miller’s writing style. She had me fully immersed in the remarkable journey of these two men from the very first pages. Their relationship blossoms into something truly admirable. Achilles proudly proclaims Patroclus as his companion, ensuring that he is seen and heard by all. He uses his elevated status to elevate Patroclus alongside him. However, the moment that anyone familiar with [the Iliad](http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.html) will be waiting for inevitably comes, and this poignant turn in the story will have you reaching for tissues.

The diverging fates and celestial destinies of Achilles and Patroclus make this a beautiful romance and epic tragedy in the stylings of the best Greek literature.

## The Song of Achilles: Characters - 4.5/5

As mentioned earlier, the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus is one that many aspire to have. They share an unwavering honesty, fearlessly addressing each other's toughest questions and steadfastly supporting one another, regardless of external opinions. Miller skillfully explores the delicate balance between their deep bond and the risks posed by their society's intolerance. It's challenging to fully articulate their personalities, as one of the novel's highlights is the character development of Achilles. Influenced by his mother's prophecies, Achilles seeks more than mere admiration from his peers. He aspires to be remembered for millennia to come, and this ambition generates considerable conflict.

I must mention that both Achilles and Patroclus are endearing characters, while Agamemnon is utterly detestable. The novel also features other [characters](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/how-to-write-believable-characters) whom you'll either love or loathe. These characters possess depth and are truly well-conceived. For me, well-written characters either evoke profound affection or intense dislike, or they possess such distinct personalities that their voices and choices become instantly recognizable due to their well-rounded development. In this case, the former criterion holds true.

## Summary of The Song of Achilles - 4.5/5

[The Song of Achilles](https://amzn.to/42TtG5h) is an absolute must-read. It has superb characters, its emotionally charged, has a believable (despite the fantastical setting) love story, an seamlessly incorporates Greek mythology. And because of this, I wholeheartedly recommend it! If I’m being honest, the only reason I haven’t given it five stars is that her second book, [Circe](https://amzn.to/431yiXm), is even better.

Whether you have an inclination toward romance, historical fiction, or fantasy, pick up this book and immerse yourself in its enchanting narrative.
