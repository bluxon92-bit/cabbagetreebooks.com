The Star Wars expanded universe is vast — decades of novels, comics, and short story collections spanning every corner of a galaxy far, far away. It can be overwhelming. Where do you start? What's actually worth reading?

This guide cuts through the noise and picks the essential reads, whether you're a first-timer or a returning fan.

## Where to Start: The Thrawn Trilogy

If you've never read a Star Wars novel, start here. Timothy Zahn's *Heir to the Empire*, *Dark Force Rising*, and *The Last Command* were published in the early 1990s and essentially revived interest in Star Wars during the franchise's quiet period. They introduced Grand Admiral Thrawn — one of the best villains in all of Star Wars — and set a template for what a great Star Wars novel could be.

These books treat the characters with intelligence, the universe with respect, and the plot with real tension. Even if you've seen them referenced everywhere, actually reading them is another experience entirely.

## The Darth Bane Trilogy

For readers who want to understand the Rule of Two — the Sith doctrine that Palpatine and Vader operate under — Drew Karpyshak's *Darth Bane: Path of Destruction* is essential. It follows the creation of the Sith's two-man structure from the inside, and Bane himself is a genuinely compelling antihero.

Dark, morally complex, and very satisfying if you've ever wondered about the deeper history of the dark side.

## Claudia Gray's Contributions

Claudia Gray has written some of the best Star Wars novels in the Disney era, full stop. *Lost Stars* is a Romeo and Juliet-style story set across the original trilogy timeline — it's widely considered one of the best Star Wars novels ever written, regardless of era.

Her *Leia: Princess of Alderaan* is also excellent, giving Leia's backstory the depth the films never had time for.

## For Fans of the Mandalorian and the Clone Wars

*Ahsoka* by E.K. Johnston follows Ahsoka Tano in the year after Order 66 — essential reading if you've watched The Clone Wars and want to know what happened next. It's thoughtful, character-driven, and hits hard emotionally if you're invested in the character.

## A Note on Canon vs Legends

Disney reorganised the Star Wars continuity in 2014, designating everything published before then as "Legends" — technically non-canon but still readable and often better than current canon material. The Thrawn Trilogy and Darth Bane are Legends. Most of Claudia Gray's work is current canon.

For what it's worth: the Legends label doesn't diminish the books at all. Read what looks interesting.
