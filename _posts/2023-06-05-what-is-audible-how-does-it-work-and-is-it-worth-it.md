The world of literature has evolved over the years, and so have the methods of consuming it, from [ebooks](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/how-to-send-ebooks-to-your-kindle) to audiobooks. Audiobooks offer a unique experience of listening to books, and Audible is the leading platform for audiobooks.

Audible is a subscription-based service that offers a vast library of audiobooks, podcasts, and other audio content.

However, the platform comes at a cost and many people wonder if Audible is worth it. In this article, we take an in-depth look at Audible, how it works, and its pros and cons.

## How Does Audible Work?

[Audible](https://amzn.to/3N5G9hu) operates on a subscription-based model, which means that users pay a monthly fee to access audiobooks and other audio content. The subscription fee includes one credit per month, which can be redeemed for one audiobook of your choice, regardless of its price. However, if you want to purchase additional audiobooks, you will have to pay for them on top of your subscription.

One of the significant benefits of Audible is that you can listen to audiobooks on multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers. All you need is to download the Audible app, sign in to your account, and access your library. Additionally, you can switch between devices and pick up where you left off.

Audible's library is vast, with over 500,000 audiobooks, including bestsellers, [classics](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/best-books-about-greek-mythology), and exclusive titles. The platform also offers podcasts, guided wellness programs, and Audible Originals, which are audiobooks created specifically for Audible.

Audible's subscription model makes it easy to access audiobooks and other audio content. However, it also means that you can’t just buy one book. You have to purchase a recurring subscription and this unlocks access to their library, but is audible worth it?

## Is Audible Worth it?

Whether Audible is worth the cost depends on several factors. Are you a reader or a listener? how many books do you listen to in a month? What kind of literature do you want to listen to (not every title is in audiobook format)? And are you willing to front the subscription fee each month?

### Cost of Audible

[Audible's subscription fee](https://www.audible.com/ep/memberbenefits) starts at $7.95 per month for the basic plan, which includes one credit per month. The premium plan costs $14.95 per month, offering two credits per month.

Additionally, Audible offers a free trial period of 30 days for new subscribers, after which you can choose to continue the subscription or cancel it.

It’s important to note that all books outside of your credits included in your plan must be purchased separately at full cost and you cannot access their library without a subscription.

However, subscriptions can be cancelled relatively easily. Plus, considering the average price of an audiobook is in the $20-$30 range if you listen to one book a month it can begin to look like a good deal.

### Comparison of Audible with traditional reading methods

Audible is an excellent option for people who don't have the time to read or want to enjoy a book on the go. It allows users to multitask while listening to audiobooks, such as doing chores, commuting, or exercising. If regularly listen to audiobooks then this could be a good way for you to get more for your money.

I have found that because I’m paying $7.95 a month, whether I use my credit or not, I make sure to listen to more audiobooks than I might otherwise. The subscription in this way encourages me to consume even more books than I already do.
