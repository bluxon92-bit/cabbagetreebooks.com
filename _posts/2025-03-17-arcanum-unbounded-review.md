If you've been reading Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere — the shared universe that connects Mistborn, Stormlight, Elantris, Warbreaker, and more — at some point you'll hear about *Arcanum Unbounded*. It's the novella collection. The supplementary material. The thing you read once you're deep enough in that you want more between the main novels.

It's also, I should say upfront, not where to start. This is not a book for Sanderson newcomers. It's a gift for the already converted.

## What's In It?

*Arcanum Unbounded* collects nine pieces of shorter fiction set across the Cosmere, each with an introduction from the fictional Khriss (an in-world scholar) explaining the planetary system it's set in. The pieces range from short stories to novellas, covering worlds and characters from across the Cosmere.

The key pieces:

**The Emperor's Soul** — the best thing in the collection and, for my money, the best novella Sanderson has written. A Forger named Shai is imprisoned and offered a terrible choice: recreate the soul of the Emperor, who has been left mentally devastated after an assassination attempt, in ninety days — or die. It's a story about identity, art, and creativity, and it works completely independently of the rest of the Cosmere. If you only read one piece in this collection, make it this one.

**Mistborn: Secret History** — a companion piece to the original Mistborn trilogy, told from the perspective of a character whose role you discover over the course of the main books. Read this only after completing the original trilogy. If you haven't — stop here, go read Mistborn, come back.

**Edgedancer** — an Stormlight Archive novella following Lift, a wonderfully strange character from *Words of Radiance*. Set between books two and three, it's essential reading for anyone invested in the series.

**Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell** — a standalone piece set in a world not yet fully explored in the main novels. Dark, atmospheric, and one of the more horror-inflected pieces in the collection.

**The Hope of Elantris** — a short piece set during the events of *Elantris*, Sanderson's first novel. Minor but pleasant for fans.

The remaining pieces are valuable to different degrees depending on how invested you are in the specific worlds they connect to.

## When to Read It

The honest answer: **after the original Mistborn trilogy and after at least the first two Stormlight books**. Most of the value in this collection comes from connection to characters and worlds you already know, and the reveals in *Secret History* in particular require that the original trilogy is complete.

*The Emperor's Soul* is the one exception — it's genuinely standalone and could be read at any point.

---

## What Works

The quality ceiling is very high. *The Emperor's Soul* is genuinely excellent fiction on any standard, not just within genre. *Edgedancer* is a delightful extended character study. *Shadows for Silence* shows a different register in Sanderson's writing — darker and more compressed — that his novel-length work doesn't often explore.

Khriss' introductions to each section are a nice touch for deep-Cosmere readers, adding a layer of in-world mythology without being necessary to enjoy the stories.

---

## What Doesn't Quite Work

The collection is uneven by nature — it's nine different pieces of different lengths written across many years. Some minor entries feel like exactly what they are: supplementary material.

**Rating: 4/5** (for established Cosmere readers; not applicable for newcomers)
