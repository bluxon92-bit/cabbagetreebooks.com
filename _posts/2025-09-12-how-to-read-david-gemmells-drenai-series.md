## What is the Drenai Series about?

The Drenai series is a heroic fantasy series by British author David Gemmell. The series focuses on a selection of heroes, mainly from the Drenai lands, and their fight against evil, whether that's a personal enemy, an existential demonic threat, or barbarian hordes.

There are 11 books in the Drenai series with two additional ones set before the rise of the Drenai. These [books](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/9-dystopian-novels-to-read) focus on singular characters and the epic quests they undertake, quests in which they will have to risk everything to succeed and that will make them legends across the lands.

## The Best Reading Order of the Drenai Series

In this article, I outline three ways you could potentially group and read the Drenai series by David Gemmell. The first is the publication order, the second is the chronological order of the series, and the third is to group them by the main protagonists of the series.

I always generally suggest reading a series in publication order, simply because this is how the author generally would have imagined them to be read. Because of this, you may get more from the plot reveals if they are established at the right time in your reading.

However, several of the books in this series can be read as standalone books, and for those of you not willing to commit to reading all 13, I've also picked my favourite (must-reads) towards the bottom of this article.

## The Iron Code of Druss The Legend

>

*“Never violate a woman, nor harm a child. Do not lie, cheat or steal. These things are for lesser men. Protect the weak against the evil strong. And never allow thoughts of gain to lead you into the pursuit of evil. Never back away from an enemy. Either fight or surrender. It is not enough to say I will not be evil. Evil must be fought wherever it is found.” *

Underpinning a lot of Gemmell’s stories is a code of morality that is exemplified in the code of Druss. This black and white code reflects what Gemmell thought it must take to be a true hero. It is an unbending aspiration to do the right thing, to defeat evil even if it means sacrificing yourself.

This is reflected in almost all of Gemmell’s heroes, and though the majority of Gemmell’s characters have darker sides to them - sides they often fail to overcome, it is this drive to do right even in the face of overwhelming odds, even at the sacrifice of their own lives that makes his characters truly speak.

## Drenai Series Grouped by Protagonist

As mentioned already many of the stories in the Drenai series can be grouped logically by the main characters in them. These three main characters are Druss, Skilgannon, and Waylander. Each of them have their own darkness to overcome and battles to fight and no doubt you’ll find yourself wanting to follow their stories so I’ve also grouped the Drenai series by the protagonist in chronological order below.

### The Druss The Legend Books

[The King Beyond the Gate](https://amzn.to/3ZD9iEc)

[Quest for Lost Heroes](https://amzn.to/3JfVRos)

## My Top Three Choices in the Drenai Series

### Legend

Being Gemmell’s first published book, this maybe isn’t his most polished. However, it glows with raw emotion that will have you in tears by the end. Druss is an incredibly memorable character that leaves you wanting more and sets the tone for many of the following stories.

### White Wolf

Skilgannon is a flawed and well-developed character with almost mystical fighting skills. He’s a hero who struggles to come to terms with his role as a warrior and a killer. Skilgannon has a pivotal meeting with Druss in this book, sending him on the path of becoming a hero and overcoming his past.

### Waylander

Waylander is an enigmatic assassin. By all accounts, he should be a villain. But as with many of Gemmell’s main characters, he judges himself harshly and we get to see that he is more than what people perceive him to be.

## Final Words

For [the best reading](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com) experience, I’d suggest sticking with the publishing order of the Drenai series. With that being said, that’s quite a lot of books, which is why I’ve also offered the character groupings and my personal recommendations.

I’ve no doubt though, that once you get started you’ll want to read them all.
