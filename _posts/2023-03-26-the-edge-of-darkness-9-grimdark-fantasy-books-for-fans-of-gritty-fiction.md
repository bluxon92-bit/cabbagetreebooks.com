Grimdark fantasy is a subgenre of speculative fiction that has gained increasing popularity in recent years. With its dark and gritty themes, morally ambiguous characters, and often violent and bleak settings, grimdark fantasy provides a unique and immersive reading experience for those who enjoy a challenge.

But what is grimdark fantasy, and where should you start if you're interested in exploring this subgenre? In this post, we delve into the defining characteristics of grimdark fantasy, highlight some of the best Grimdark and Dark Fantasy [books for fantasy lovers](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/29-best-fantasy-books), and provide some tips on where to begin your Grimdark journey.

## What is Grimdark Fantasy?

Though challenging to get a precise description of grimdark fantasy, many common elements are found throughout Grmidark fiction. For example, it’s characterized by its dark and gritty themes, which are often explored through morally ambiguous characters and settings that are bleak and unforgiving. Some even go so far as to describe it as the fantasy equivalent of [dystopian sci-fi](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/9-dystopian-novels-to-read).

Below we break down some of the key characteristics frequently found in grimdark fantasy:

-
  **Dark and Gritty Themes:** Grimdark fantasy often explores themes of war, betrayal, and moral ambiguity. It frequently delves into topics that are uncomfortable or taboo.
-
  **Anti-Heroes or Morally Ambiguous Characters:** Many grimdark fantasy books feature protagonists who are deeply flawed. These characters often have questionable motivations and are not always likeable or heroic - in other settings, they would be considered a villain. (Mark Lawrence’s Broken Empire series which we explore later in this article is a good example of a villainous protagonist.)
-
  **Violence and Gore: **Grimdark fantasy doesn't shy away from getting messy. It often features graphic descriptions of battles, torture, and other violent acts.
-
  **Lack of Hope: **In many of these fantasy books there is a somewhat pessimistic outlook on the world. The cruelty that the characters experience is unforgiving and realistic, and presents insurmountable obstacles that can’t be overcome without some sacrifice.
-
  **A Bleak World:** The [world-building](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/15-steps-to-fantasy-world-building) in grimdark fantasy is typically dark and foreboding, with a focus on realism.

By embracing these defining characteristics, grimdark fantasy provides a unique and often challenging reading experience that can be both rewarding and thought-provoking.

The first in the Broken Empire Trilogy (and Mark Lawrence’s debut novel) is A Prince of Thorns. It tells a tale of blood and treachery, magic and brotherhood and paints a compelling and brutal, and sometimes beautiful, picture of the young prince Jorg Ancrath on his journey toward manhood and the throne. With his ruthless tactics and disregard for human life, Jorg is a compelling antihero who must confront the consequences of his own actions as he seeks to conquer the world around him.

### 5. A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin (published 1996 - present)

A Song of Ice and Fire is a sprawling epic that follows a vast cast of characters spread out across the seven kingdoms of Westeros and beyond. It is one of the most ambitious examples of world-building since Tolkien. It explores themes of power, family, and the consequences of human ambition.

The series is famous for shocking violence where the main characters apparently devoid of plot armour are gratuitously murdered, maimed and worse. With such high stakes for even central characters, the Game of Thrones books have an uncommon realism that makes them stand out and will have you on the edge of your seat (despite the length of the novels published to date).

Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy follows the story of FitzChivalry Farseer, the bastard son of a prince who is trained as an assassin for the royal family. Set in a world of political intrigue and courtly scheming, the novel explores themes of duty, loyalty, and the high cost of power.

While some readers may not consider Assassin's Apprentice to be strictly Grimdark, it certainly contains many of the hallmarks of the subgenre, such as its focus on morally ambiguous characters, its depiction of violence and brutality, and its exploration of the darker aspects of human nature. Hobb's portrayal of the character of FitzChivalry, in particular, has been praised for its nuance and complexity, as he struggles to reconcile his duty as an assassin with his own sense of morality and loyalty to his friends.

## Dark Fantasy Books vs Grimdark Fantasy Books: What’s the Difference?

While there is some overlap between Dark Fantasy and Grimdark, the key difference between the two is in their tone and focus. Dark Fantasy and Grimdark are both subgenres of fantasy that deal with darker and more mature themes, but there are some key differences between the two.

Dark Fantasy typically refers to works of fantasy that incorporate elements of horror or the supernatural, and often involve morally ambiguous characters and settings that are darker and more atmospheric than traditional fantasy. Examples of Dark Fantasy books include Neil Gaiman's "Sandman" series, Anne Rice's "The Vampire Chronicles," and H.P. Lovecraft's stories. Dark Fantasy books often explore themes of mortality, identity, and the nature of good and evil.

Grimdark, on the other hand, is a subgenre of fantasy that is characterized by its harsh realism, moral ambiguity, bleak world-building, and often are feature gritty violence. Because of this I actually find the characters in grimdark fantasy books tend to be more relatable and multi-dimensional than in other fantasy subgenres. They have [complex character motivations](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/how-to-write-believable-characters) that are never wholly good but are realistically selfish. The villains as well are often more understandable and so the line between good and evil becomes blurred or disappears entirely.

Ultimately, both the Grimdark Fantasy and Dark Fantasy subgenres offer readers a chance to explore mature and complex themes in the context of a rich and imaginative fantasy world.

## Final Words: Where to Start Reading Grimdark Fantasy

If you're new to grimdark fantasy, starting can be intimidating. However, there are a few things you can do to find your footing and get started:

**Consider your reading preferences:** Grimdark fantasy is a complex subgenre with many different themes and styles. Before you dive in, take some time to think about what you enjoy in a book. Do you prefer action and adventure, political intrigue, or philosophical musings? This will help you choose a series that you're more likely to enjoy.

**Read reviews and recommendations:** Reading reviews and recommendations from others who have already read the books can give you a good sense of what to expect. You'll get an idea of the writing style, the characters, and the overall tone of the series. This can help you decide if a particular series is right for you.

My personal favourites on this list are [Joe Abercrombie’s The First Law Trilogy](/blog/joe-abercrombie-books-in-order) and [Robin Hobb’s Farseer trilogy](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/robin-hobb-farseer-and-beyond) and so if you’re really stuck these are definitely great places to begin. Other fantasy authors you might enjoy but didn’t make it onto this list include [John Gwynne](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/john-gwynne-gods-malice-and-wrath) (his Bloodsworn Saga is phenomenal), and my personal favourite [David Gemmel who you can learn more about here](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/david-gemmells-drenai-series).
