I've been waiting for *The Doors of Stone* for over a decade. I have no regrets. Some wounds are worth carrying.

If you're new to Patrick Rothfuss, first of all — lucky you. You get to read *The Name of the Wind* without already knowing how long you'll wait for the conclusion. Enjoy that.

Here's everything Rothfuss has published, and the order to read it.

## The Kingkiller Chronicle

The series follows Kvothe — legendary hero, feared warrior, accomplished musician, and innkeeper — as he recounts his own life story to a Chronicler over three days. It's a story within a story, and the framing device is part of what makes it special.

### 1. The Name of the Wind (2007)

The first day of Kvothe's account. We follow him from a difficult childhood in a travelling troupe of performers, through poverty and loss, to his arrival at the University — a place of learning and arcane magic — and his early years there.

What sets *The Name of the Wind* apart isn't really the plot, though the plot is good. It's the prose. Rothfuss writes with a musicality and precision that's genuinely rare in fantasy, and Kvothe is one of the most compelling narrators in the genre. He's talented, arrogant, poor, and perpetually making things harder for himself than they need to be. He's insufferable and brilliant in roughly equal measure. You'll love him.

The magic system — Sympathy, which involves creating links between objects to transfer energy between them — is one of the best constructed in modern fantasy. It has internal logic, meaningful cost, and feels genuinely learned rather than wielded.

### 2. The Wise Man's Fear (2011)

The second day. Kvothe leaves the University and the book broadens significantly — taking him to a foreign court, to training with the legendary Adem fighters, and to the mysterious land of the Fae. It's longer than *The Name of the Wind*, arguably looser in structure, and probably the more divisive of the two. Some readers love the expansion. Others find the Fae section too extended.

I'm in the "love it" camp. The Adem sections alone are worth the price of admission — a warrior culture built around radical honesty and a completely alien approach to emotion. And the final act, back at the University, sets up threads that will presumably pay off in Book 3.

## The Novella

### The Slow Regard of Silent Things (2014)

A novella set during *The Wise Man's Fear*, following Auri — a mysterious young woman who lives in the tunnels beneath the University. It's a strange, quiet, beautiful book that is emphatically not for everyone. Rothfuss says as much in his introduction, which is worth reading before you start.

There is no conventional plot. No conflict in the traditional sense. It's essentially an extended character study of a compelling person doing small things, rendered with extraordinary care.

If you liked Auri in the main series, read it after *The Wise Man's Fear*. If you're primarily interested in Kvothe's story, it's skippable without missing anything plot-critical.

## What About Book 3?

*The Doors of Stone* is the final book in the Kingkiller Chronicle. It will complete Kvothe's third day of storytelling and resolve the frame narrative. As of 2026, it has not been published.

Rothfuss has spoken about working on it for many years. The book will come out when it comes out. In the meantime, the two existing novels are complete experiences that stand up to re-reading.

## The Audiobooks

Worth mentioning: the audiobooks, narrated by Nick Podehl, are exceptional. Podehl is one of the best narrators in the business and gives Kvothe a voice that feels exactly right. If you enjoy audiobooks, this is one of the best in the fantasy genre.

## Who Is This Series For?

*The Kingkiller Chronicle* is for readers who value prose and character above all else. If you want constant forward momentum and are allergic to introspection, this might frustrate you. If you love language, complex characters, and a world that feels genuinely inhabited, this is among the best the genre has to offer.

Readers who love Rothfuss tend to also enjoy [*Empire of Silence* by Christopher Ruocchio](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/empire-of-silence-review) — another first-person account of a legendary figure's early life, enormous in scope and beautifully written.
