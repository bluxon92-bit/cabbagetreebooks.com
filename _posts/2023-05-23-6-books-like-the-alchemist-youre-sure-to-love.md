## About The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnkddcxrt/image/upload/sq_images/the-alchemist-1-.jpg)

["The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho](https://amzn.to/42WQW3a) is a concise yet impactful book that delves into profound themes and offers a timeless message. Written in simple language, it emphasizes the pursuit of dreams. Its power lies in its lyrical charm and effective use of allegory and metaphor, which convey its message whilst making it accessible to a wide audience.

Coelho explores various themes, including karmic returns, critical thinking, the nature of goodness, and the meaning of life. Nevertheless, the resounding message is clear: unwavering determination is crucial in achieving one's desires, as illustrated by the protagonist Santiago's relentless pursuit of his personal legend.

Throughout the story Santiago comes up against numerous obstacles, he leaves behind everything he knows to travel to a land where he doesn’t even speak the language. He’s robbed, crosses a desert and faces potential death at the hands of bandits. However, Santiago overcomes each of these obstacles in turn and meets a number of inspiring individuals pursuing their own destinies. His journey grants him profound insights into the world and the interconnectedness of everything.

Ultimately, "The Alchemist" highlights that even if Santiago had not attained his treasure, his journey would still have been fulfilling because he followed his personal legend and embraced his destiny. The book encourages readers to reevaluate their priorities and reconsider their way of life. It reminds us that although we share a common destination, the journey itself and the people we encounter along the way are what truly matter.

There is a wonderful allegory in the novel that describes the secret of happiness which sums up the novel nicely. I have paraphrased it for you at the bottom of this article. Click here to jump ahead to read it.

### The Secret of Happiness: An Allegory from The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho

The following is an allegory that features in The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho. It’s written from memory (as I’ve lent all of my copies of The Alchemist to others) and aims to reflect the primary message of the original as well as the writing style. If you want to read the original you can [get The Alchemist on Amazon here.](https://amzn.to/3pOZyKF)

There once was a shopkeeper who sent his son to learn about the secrets of happiness from the wisest man in the world. The young man travelled the desert for forty days and nights and finally came to a magnificent castle that sat atop a tall hill - the place where the wise man lived.

The son waited patiently whilst the wise man conversed with all those that had come to him and there were many.

Finally his turn, the boy explains that he has come seeking the secret of happiness, and the wise man listens carefully. When he’s done the wise man says, “I don’t have time right now to answer your question, come back in two hours. While you wait, why don’t you look around the palace?  However, I want you to do something whilst you explore, carry this spoon without spilling a single drop.’ And he handed the boy a spoon filled with oil.

The boy thinks, well this is a strange request, but he does as he’s asked. He takes the spoon and steps into the great palace hallways. Descends and ascends the stairways. He walks slowly around the palace his hand held steadily before him his gaze fixed upon the spoon. When he returns to the wise man, he holds out the spoon and he says, “Look, I’ve walked all around your palace and I haven’t spilt a single drop.”

The wise man smiles at him. “Tell me what did you think of the architecture? For I have had the very best sculptors and artisans work on this palace for many years. Did you see the Persian tapestries or the paintings that line the hallways, done by the greatest masters in the world? What of the gardens?”

The boy blushed and admitted that he hadn’t seen any of these things.

The wise man sighed. “I don’t have an answer for you yet,” he says. “Why don’t you go look again, take in the marvels I’ve collected here and return again in two hours.”

The boy nods and leaves the wise man’s hall once more, relieved. He steps into the grand corridors and marvels at the exquisite paintings and Persian tapestries, at the detail in the architecture. He’s stunned by the beauty of the statues. He rushes from marvel to marvel his eyes wide with wonder. When he comes to the garden he gawks at an arrangement of plants he’s never seen before, a world of colour and water he didn’t believe was possible. Eventually, he returns to the wise man.

“My lord, your palace is truly magnificent!” He can barely contain his excitement or his praise as he relates in detail the wonders that he’d seen.

The wise man smiling eventually calms the boy’s excitement and says. “But, what of the oil I entrusted you with?”

The boy looks down at the spoon still in his hand, and there’s not a single drop left. He looks up at the wise man in surprise. He’d completely forgotten about it, so wrapped up in the beauty around him had he become.

“The secret of happiness,” the wise man then says, “is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.”
