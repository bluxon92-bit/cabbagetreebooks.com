Half the fantasy readers I know have a Sarah J. Maas phase. Some go in reluctantly, dragged there by a friend who won't shut up about Rhysand. Others dive straight in having heard the hype and emerge three months later, hollow-eyed and emotionally wrecked, asking what to read next.

If you're at the beginning of this journey — welcome. Here's everything you need to know.

Maas has written three major fantasy series, all set in different worlds, all with that signature blend of epic stakes, complex politics, and characters who are, at minimum, extremely attractive and extremely troubled. She also writes romance into her fantasy more explicitly as the series have gone on, so if that's not your thing, stick to the earlier Throne of Glass books and you'll be fine.

Here's the full breakdown.

---

## The Throne of Glass Series

This is where it all started. Throne of Glass is Maas' first series, published from 2012 to 2018, and it's the one I'd recommend starting with for most readers. It begins more YA in tone and grows into something considerably darker and more epic. Think of it as the series that earns its grimdark credentials over time.

### 1. Throne of Glass

Celaena Sardothien is an assassin — the best in the kingdom — who's been enslaved in the salt mines of Endovier. When the Crown Prince offers her a deal (compete in a tournament of champions, win her freedom), she takes it. What follows is part murder mystery, part competition, part political intrigue, and entirely the setup for something much bigger.

Be aware: this first book is lighter than what comes after. Some readers find it a bit slow to grab them. Stick with it.

[**Rated 4.1 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/throneofglass)

### 2. Crown of Midnight

This is where the series properly takes off. Stakes escalate, the world opens up, and Celaena becomes considerably more interesting. If you're on the fence after book one, [Crown of Midnight](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/crown-of-midnight-review) is the one that turns doubters into devotees.

[**Rated 4.4 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/crownofmidnight)

### 3. Heir of Fire

The scope expands dramatically. New lands, new magic, and a protagonist grappling with who she really is. [Heir of Fire](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/heir-of-fire-review) is where Maas starts writing at the level she became famous for.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/heiroffire)

### 4. Queen of Shadows

Old alliances fracture. New ones form. Celaena/Aelin takes on the empire more directly. This is big, sprawling, action-heavy fantasy.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/queenofshadows)

### 5. Empire of Storms

The penultimate entry cranks everything up. At this point you'll either be fully invested or you'll have bailed several books ago. If you're still here, Empire of Storms won't disappoint.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/empireofstorms)

### 6. Tower of Dawn

Technically a companion novel to Empire of Storms, set concurrently. You can read it before, after, or interleaved. Most readers enjoy it after, but it works either way.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/towerofdawn)

### 7. Kingdom of the Wicked

The finale. Everything converges. It's enormous. It's emotionally devastating. It earns its ending.

[**Rated 4.6 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/kingdomofthewicked)

### The Assassin's Blade (Prequel Novellas)

Five prequel novellas collected in one volume. Read them after Heir of Fire for maximum impact — they hit differently once you know who Celaena really is.

## A Court of Thorns and Roses (ACOTAR)

Published from 2015 onwards, ACOTAR is set in a completely separate world from Throne of Glass. It's a Beauty-and-the-Beast retelling that becomes something considerably more complex — and considerably more adult — as the series progresses. If Throne of Glass is a slow burn from YA to adult fantasy, ACOTAR makes the jump more abruptly.

### 1. A Court of Thorns and Roses

A huntress kills a wolf in the woods. It was a faerie. This does not go well for her. The first book is relatively self-contained and works as a retelling with its own complete arc.

[**Rated 4.3 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/acothorns)

### 2. A Court of Mist and Fury

Widely considered the best book in the series. If ACOTAR didn't fully hook you, ACOMAF likely will. The worldbuilding explodes, the characters become genuinely fascinating, and Maas is writing at her peak here.

[**Rated 4.7 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/acomaf)

### 3. A Court of Wings and Ruin

The conclusion to the main arc. Big battles, high stakes, satisfying resolutions.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/acowar)

### 4. A Court of Frost and Starlight

A bridge novella between the main trilogy and the next books. More quiet character work than plot. Fine, but skippable if you're in a hurry.

### 5. A Court of Silver Flames

Focus shifts to Nesta. More intense, more explicit, and a genuinely strong standalone within the series.

[**Rated 4.6 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/acosilverflames)

## Crescent City

Maas' most recent series is a contemporary fantasy — set in a world much like ours, but with magic, Fae, angels, and the descendants of various mythological beings living alongside humans. It's the most explicitly adult of her three series.

### 1. House of Earth and Blood

Bryce Quinlan investigates a murder in a magic-soaked city. It's longer than it needs to be in places but the world-building is impressive and the characters stick.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/houseofearth)

### 2. House of Sky and Breath

Expands the world significantly and starts connecting threads to her other series in ways that will either thrill or bewilder you depending on how deep in you are.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/houseofsky)

### 3. House of Flame and Shadow

The finale. Maas goes full Cosmere here — connections to both TOG and ACOTAR feature prominently.

[**Rated 4.6 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/houseofflame)

## Which Series Should You Start With?

Start with **Throne of Glass** if you prefer a slower build, enjoy a coming-of-age arc, and want to see Maas develop as a writer in real time. It's the most traditional fantasy of her three series.

Start with **ACOTAR** if you want to jump straight into the most immediately gripping world, don't mind a retelling premise, and are happy for things to get more romantic and adult as the series progresses.

**Crescent City** is best saved for last — it rewards familiarity with the other two series and its crossover moments hit much harder if you've read everything else first.

## Final Thoughts

Whatever you think of the romance elements (and opinions are, to put it diplomatically, divided), there's no denying Maas can build a world and sustain it across thousands of pages. The politics, the magic systems, the sheer scope of what she's constructed across three interconnected series — it's genuinely impressive.

Just clear your schedule first.
