The problem with recommending fantasy to someone new to the genre is that "fantasy" covers an enormous range. The question isn't really "what's a good fantasy novel" — it's "what kind of reading experience are you looking for, and which fantasy novel delivers that most directly."

This guide organises recommendations by reader type. Find where you recognise yourself and start there.

## If You Want Something Accessible and Self-Contained

### The Hobbit — J.R.R. Tolkien

Still the best entry point to fantasy as a genre. A small, homely creature is persuaded against his better judgement to join a quest. Tolkien writes it with warmth, wit, and a pace that honours a reader's time. It's shorter than most people expect and it ends properly.

[**Rated 4.8 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/thehobbit)

### Mistborn — Brandon Sanderson

A heist in an ash-covered world where the dark lord already won. The magic system (Allomancy, using swallowed metals) is inventive and rigorously logical, the plot moves efficiently, and the trilogy has one of the most satisfying conclusions in modern fantasy. Sanderson is the genre's most accessible serious author.

[**Rated 4.7 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/mistborn)

## If You Loved Game of Thrones (TV) and Want the Books

### A Game of Thrones — George R.R. Martin

The TV series improved on the books' pacing but compressed and eventually diverged from the source material. The books are richer, more complex, and give you characters the show never developed. Start here and expect around 5,000 pages of investment if you go the full distance.

[**Rated 4.7 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/gameofthrones)

### The Blade Itself — Joe Abercrombie

If what you loved about GoT was the moral complexity, the subversion of fantasy conventions, and the sense that being good doesn't protect you — Abercrombie is the author who does this most consistently and the First Law is where to start.

## If You Prefer Character and Emotion Over Plot

### The Farseer Trilogy — Robin Hobb

The most emotionally devastating fantasy series I know. FitzChivalry Farseer's life is a prolonged study in the gap between capability and outcome, in how people who care about you can still ruin you, in what it means to be expendable to the people you love. Unforgettable. [Full guide here.](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/robin-hobb-farseer-and-beyond)

[**Rated 4.7 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/assassinsapprentice)

### The Name of the Wind — Patrick Rothfuss

The finest prose in modern fantasy, a narrator who makes you believe in his own legend, and a magic system (Sympathy) built with genuine intellectual rigour. Less plot-driven than most fantasy — this is fundamentally about character — but for the right reader it's one of the best things in the genre.

## If You Want Something Warm and Character-Driven (Less Violence)

### The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet — Becky Chambers

Cozy sci-fi rather than fantasy, but the appeal is the same: a diverse crew on a small ship, a long journey, and the texture of daily life among genuinely interesting people. No trauma. No grimdark. Deeply comforting. [Full review here.](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/the-long-way-to-a-small-angry-planet-review)

[**Rated 4.4 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/longwaysmallangryplanet)

### The Goblin Emperor — Katherine Addison

A sheltered young man inherits an empire he doesn't want and has to figure out how to rule with kindness in a court designed to punish it. Warm, intelligent, complete in one volume. No villain wins. Good things happen. Radical in the current fantasy landscape.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/goblinemperor)

## If You Want Something Original and Literary

### Piranesi — Susanna Clarke

Fifty thousand words. A man in a House with infinite halls. A mystery about identity and reality that rewards careful reading. One of the most original fantasy novels of the last decade and short enough to read in a single sitting if you're so inclined. [On our standalone fantasy list.](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/best-standalone-fantasy-novels)

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/piranesi)

### Senlin Ascends — Josiah Bancroft

A schoolteacher loses his wife on honeymoon in the Tower of Babel. The world-building is extraordinary, the prose is beautiful, and the plot is genuinely surprising. The best-kept secret in contemporary fantasy. [Full review here.](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/senlin-ascends-review)

## The One Book I'd Give Any New Fantasy Reader

If I could only recommend one: **Mistborn**. It's self-contained in its original trilogy, it demonstrates what the genre does uniquely (magic systems, world-building, the pleasure of rules being set up and then used), and the ending delivers. It's not the most literary entry on this list or the most emotionally devastating. It is the most reliably converting.

Come back and read everything else after.
