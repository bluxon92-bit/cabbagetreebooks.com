## 7 of the Best Classic Fantasy Books

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnkddcxrt/image/upload/sq_images/narnia-fantasy-books-1-.jpeg)

### 1. [The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe](https://www.amazon.com/Lion-Witch-Wardrobe-C-Lewis/dp/0064471047/) by C.S. Lewis

A classic we’re likely all already familiar with. The Chronicles of Narnia was a staple story when I was younger but it wasn’t until I revisited the series more recently that I really appreciated them.

The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is the most famous title and follows the adventures of the Pevensie children. The story has heavy religious symbolism, most obviously when the lion Aslan is sacrificed and resurrected. However, this symbolism isn’t what still draws modern readers to its pages. At its heart, it’s a tale of an epic adventure with earth-shattering stakes where the Pevensie children, after escaping war-torn Britain, discover a magical wardrobe that leads to the Kingdom of Narnia. Here they become embroiled in an ancient prophecy and must face down great evil to save the world.

### 2. [The Picture of Dorian Gray](https://www.amazon.com/Picture-Dorian-Gray-Oscar-Wilde/dp/B098CR95HV/) by Oscar Wilde

Oscar Wilde’s best-known work revolves around a young man, Dorian Gray, who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. Dorian quickly devolves into hedonism and sensualism, with the belief that the only things worth pursuing are beauty and pleasure.

This text was subject to much controversy and criticism in its time but has come to be recognized as a classic of gothic literature and is a must-read.

### 3. [The Lord of The Rings](https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Boxed-Set/dp/0358439191/) by J.R.R.Tolkien

We are likely all familiar with J.R.R. Tolkien’s genre-defining Lord of the Rings trilogy. An epic fantasy series about the 3rd age of Middle Earth. It’s a story of good vs evil, of wizards, elves, dwarves and, of course, hobbits. And it’s also a profound meditation on the indomitable power of hope.

The first volume launches an unlikely band of heroes on a vast journey, from Middle-earth’s highest peaks to its darkest caverns. And all the while the forces of the dark lord Sauron seek to defeat them and reclaim their master’s ultimate weapon, the one ring.

### 4. [The Bloody Chamber](https://www.amazon.com/Bloody-Chamber-Stories-75th-Anniversary-Classics/dp/0143107615/) by Angela Carter

The Bloody Chamber is actually a selection of ten [fantasy short stories](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/fantasy-short-stories). They were first collectively published in 1979 and have since become a polemical text for feminist fantasy. Each story revisits a traditional fairy tale - Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood and Beauty and the Beast, to name a few - and reexamines and subverts the role of women in these stories. An instant classic, The Bloody Chamber by Angela Carter is cited by numerous authors as a major influence on their own work.

### 5. [Treasure Island](https://www.amazon.com/Treasure-Island-Robert-Louis-Stevenson-ebook/dp/B07VGY1BBZ/) by Robert Louis Stevenson

Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is an exciting and gripping adventure story that follows young Jim Hawkins and his quest to uncover the treasure of the infamous pirate, Captain Flint. However, it’s not the captain, but the villainous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. This work has had a significant impact on [fiction](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/fiction-vs-nonfiction-whats-the-difference) over the years shaping and colouring our perception of pirates, adventure, and of course gold.

### 6. [Gulliver’s Travels](https://www.amazon.com/Gullivers-Travels-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486292738/) by Jonathan Swift

Shaped as a work of travel writing, Gulliver’s Travels is a satire that documents the story of Lemuel Gulliver as he is subjected o a bizarre turn of events, travelling to unknown lands and meeting unbelievable characters, from the tiny Lilliputians whose size represents their smallness of mind, to a fictional race of intelligent, rational horses called Houyhnhnms.

Not only is this a gripping adventure story, but satirises many human faults that can still be seen today from the ridiculous customs and petty debates of the Lilliputians to the obsessions with shiny objects and otherwise valueless items of the Yahoos.

### 7. [Phantasmion](https://www.amazon.com/Phantasmion-Sara-Coleridge-ebook/dp/B08Y6Y8DYH/) by Sara Coleridge

Inspired by her own children, Coleridge produced a novel that’s both lively and entertaining. Phantasmion: A Fairy Tale is an unforgettable story about the resilience of an imaginary prince. The narrative promotes perseverance and peace but also demonstrates the intensity and selfishness of young love and the anguish and grief that so often accompanies a lack of reciprocity of such love.

In the story, Phantasmion is the king of a fantastical realm who is forced into a series of trials that require him to seek help from unexpected allies. It’s a captivating adventure full of vibrant characters and internal and external conflicts.

## 12 of the Best Modern Fantasy Books

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnkddcxrt/image/upload/sq_images/game-of-thrones-shelf-1-.jpeg)

### 8. [Game of Thrones](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Song-Fire-Book/dp/0553381687) by George R.R. Martin

When George R.R. Martin published the first book in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, no one could have predicted its phenomenal success. This series is full of political intrigue, bloodshed, betrayal, and sex (all the good stuff). Set in a medievalesque world with dragons, mysterious and unexplained magic, ice zombies, and more it pairs jaw-dropping surprises with subverted [fantasy tropes](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/book-tropes-you-need-to-know) to incredible effect. And we can all just hope that he gets around to finishing the series eventually.

### 9. [The Name of The Wind](https://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Patrick-Rothfuss/dp/0756404746/) by Patrick Rothfuss

The Name of the Wind is a gripping and compelling story of a young man named Kvothe. It starts with him in a troupe of travelling players, but when he meets a man who can speak the name of the Wind he becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth of true magic. He pursues his obsession relentlessly, but his journey is filled with trials, seemingly as if the whole world is against him, and he must apply both talent and hard work to overcome them.

Interestingly, this story is told from the first person in the future where things have taken a  dark turn for our protagonist and it leaves the audience questioning the reliability of the narrator. Patrick Rothfuss is a brilliant author and his tale will have you spinning through the pages, and whilst we’re still all eagerly waiting on the third book, don’t let that stop you from getting started with The Name of The Wind and the second in the series, The Wise Man’s Fear.

### 10. [The Wheel of Time](https://www.amazon.com/Wheel-Time-Premium-Boxed-Set/dp/1250251516/) by Robert Jordan

Published in 1990, The Wheel of Time is one of the most popular and influential fantasy epics ever written. It is a hugely ambitious undertaking, steeped in rich history and with incredible scale to its world-building. The series spans fourteen books and ultimately redefined the genre of epic fantasy. This skillfully written series was finished after Jordan’s death by [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/11-best-books-by-brandon-sanderson), an author you’ll find further down this list.

### 11. [Assassin’s Apprentice](https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Apprentice-Farseer-Trilogy-Book/dp/055357339X/) by Robin Hobb

Fitz is the bastard son of the crown prince, a young man born between two worlds. When it is determined that he might be of use to the crown he is adopted into the court and thrown into a new world of intrigue and plotting, courtly manners and murder.

But the Wit is a dangerous magic and one that is abhorred by the nobility.

### 12. [A Wizard of Earthsea](https://www.amazon.com/Earthsea-Trilogy-Wizard-Tombs-Farthest/dp/0739452711/) by Ursula K. Le Guin

In the first book in the Earthsea Quartet, Ursula K Le Guin does something a little different. There are no great battles or courtly plots. Instead, the story follows the character Ged as he learns of his affinity for magic, becomes enraptured by his own hubris and learns humility the hard way. It is a tale of adventure and personal growth, exploring the wonderful world of Earthsea, with dragons, magic, and mystery on every page.

### 13. [The Way of Kings](https://www.amazon.com/Way-Kings-Book-Stormlight-Archive/dp/0765326353/) by Brandon Sanderson

Book 1 in the Stormlight Series, [The Way of Kings is Brandon Sanderson’s ](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/11-best-books-by-brandon-sanderson)biggest challenge yet. The book explores the lives of the Heralds, the leaders of the Knights Radiant. The Heralds have waged war against a race of monsters, called Voidbringers, for thousands of years, protecting humanity from certain destruction. However, after countless rebirths, the Heralds abandon their calling and cast the world into chaos. This story is epic in scope and scale and arguably Sanderson’s masterwork.

The protagonist Lessa, her parents murdered, her birthright stolen, is an outcast and a survivor who dreams of revenge. However, when an ancient threat to Pern emerges Lessa must cast aside her personal grudges and rise to the occasion and face it head-on.

After his release, he is recruited by the mysterious Mr. Wednesday to join him on a journey across America to recruit old gods to join the battle against the new gods.

### 17. [The Colour of Magic](https://www.amazon.com/First-Discworld-Novels-Colour-Fantastic/dp/0861404211/) by Terry Pratchett

You can’t have a list of the best fantasy stories without featuring Terry Pratchett. While I’d encourage you to pick up literally any of his work (I’m especially fond of the Captain Vines books), The Colour of Magic is the first Discworld novel, a hugely enjoyable read, and a great place to start.

It follows the adventures of the inept wizard, Rincewind, and the naive tourist, Twoflower, as they travel the magical Discworld. Along the way, they encounter dragons, gods, and magical creatures. On more than one occasion they manage to escape trouble through a combination of luck, ill-fated prophecy, and accident.

The novel is filled with witty dialogue, clever puns, and satirical social commentary. It is an amusing and entertaining read that is sure to delight fantasy fans.

### 18. [Echoes of the Great Song](https://www.amazon.com/Echoes-Great-Song-Heroic-Fantasy-ebook/dp/B0031RS6TG/) by David Gemmel

Echoes of the Great Song is one of my favourite [David Gemmel](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/david-gemmells-drenai-series) books with complex heroes, magic, and evil. Set in a world where a race known as Avatars had once mastered the power of the sun and become gods, however, after an apocalypse their powers wane and a new threat arises. The Avatars must choose to save themselves or save the world from this rising evil. It’s a story of bravery, friendship, sacrifice and courage, and one of Gemmel’s absolute classics.

### 19. [Hard Boiled Wonderland at the Edge of The World](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Boiled-Wonderland-World-Haruki-Murakami-ebook/dp/B005TKD9D6/) by Haruki Murakami

Haruki Murakami's Hard Boiled Wonderland at the End of The World is a surrealist fantasy novel that follows the story of an unnamed protagonist as he navigates two alternate realities. In one world, he works as a Calcutec, a human data processor, and in the other, well that’s filled with abstract curiosities and mysterious unicorns. Murakami cleverly brings these two worlds together like the master craftsman he is, until the protagonist finally unravels the two realities.

Throughout the novel, Murakami employs dreamlike imagery and magical realism to explore themes of identity, memory, and the search for meaning in an increasingly technological world.

## The Best Fantasy Books: Wrapping Up
[

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnkddcxrt/image/upload/sq_images/drenai-series-banner.png)

](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/david-gemmells-drenai-series)

As a final note, I'd like to pick out my personal favourites of the authors featured in this list. For these authors, I’d recommend more or less every single one of their not-insignificant bodies of work.

[Terry Pratchett’s](https://www.terrypratchettbooks.com) work is wonderful, hilarious, and on occasion deeply philosophical. I’m sure I’m not the only one who picked one up in a charity shop and then didn’t stop reading until i’d consumed them all.

On that same note, [Neil Gaiman](https://www.neilgaiman.com), a lifelong friend of Pratchett’s, is far less prolific than many of the others on this list but is an incredible author. His stories have a mystery and darkness to them which is compelling and bizarre.

[Brandon Sanderson’s books](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/11-best-books-by-brandon-sanderson) all share fast-paced and dynamic plots with [great characters](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/writers-blog/how-to-create-a-character-profile) and intricate magic systems, making them perfect escapes from reality.

And finally, David Gemmel. I spent many of my later teen years devouring his books, everything from his [Drenai series](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/david-gemmells-drenai-series) to his later historical fantasy [fiction works that revolve around ancient Greece](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/best-books-about-greek-mythology) - a particular favourite of mine is The Lion of Macedon.
