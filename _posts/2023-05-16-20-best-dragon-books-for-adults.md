## The Best Dragon Books: Final Words

The 20 titles on this list of the best dragon books are a great starting point for any reader looking to explore the world of dragons in literature however, there are a few notable exclusions.

For example, I haven’t included Tolkien’s The Hobbit, Christopher Paolini’s wildly successful Eragon (a personal favourite of mine in my teen years), or even [Harry Potter,](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/books-like-harry-potter) the fourth volume The Goblet of Fire for example features dragons as one of the main challenges that Harry has to overcome as part of the Triwizard cup. The reason I left these off is that everyone’s heard of these - they are ubiquitous, almost synonymous when you think about magical fantasy featuring dragons.

My personal favourites on the above list are Temeraire and [Robin Hobbs's Realm of the Elderling series](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/robin-hobb-farseer-and-beyond). But, each of these books listed stands out for different reasons and there should be something to cater to every taste. So, whether you're looking for epic battles or heartwarming relationships between dragons and humans, there's a dragon book out there for you.
