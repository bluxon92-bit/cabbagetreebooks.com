Right. So you've decided to read Throne of Glass. Good choice. Now let me save you the ten minutes of confused Googling I did before my first read, because the series order is slightly complicated by a prequel novella collection and a companion novel that doesn't quite slot in chronologically.

Here's the order I'd recommend, and why.

## The Recommended Reading Order

### 1. Throne of Glass

Start here. Celaena Sardothien, the kingdom's most feared assassin, gets yanked out of a slave mine to compete in a tournament for her freedom. Murder mystery meets political intrigue. It's lighter than what comes later but sets everything up.

[**Rated 4.1 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/throneofglass)

---

### 2. Crown of Midnight

This is where the series genuinely begins. If book one felt a bit too YA for your taste, book two answers that concern within the first fifty pages. The plot thickens, the stakes get real, and Celaena's true nature starts to emerge. [Read our full review here.](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/crown-of-midnight-review)

[**Rated 4.4 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/crownofmidnight)

---

### 3. The Assassin's Blade (Prequel Novellas)

Five stories set before the main series, following a younger Celaena. You *can* read these first, and some people prefer it that way, but I'd hold off until after Crown of Midnight. The novellas hit significantly harder once you understand what they cost her.

### 4. Heir of Fire

The world doubles in size. Celaena travels to a new kingdom, trains with Fae warriors, and grapples with a secret she's been carrying the entire series. This is the book where Maas hits her stride. [Full review here.](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/heir-of-fire-review)

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/heiroffire)

---

### 5. Queen of Shadows

She's done hiding. This is a more aggressive, more confident book — full of confrontation and long-overdue reckoning. New alliances, old enemies, explosive action.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/queenofshadows)

---

### 6. Empire of Storms

The penultimate book is enormous and doesn't slow down. Revelations stack on top of revelations. You'll want to start Kingdom of the Wicked immediately after.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/empireofstorms)

---

### 7. Tower of Dawn (Companion Novel)

Set simultaneously with Empire of Storms and following a secondary character on their own mission. You can read this before, after, or interleaved with Empire of Storms. After works fine and is probably the simplest approach.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/towerofdawn)

---

### 8. Kingdom of the Wicked

The finale. Every thread from seven books comes home to roost. Devastating and satisfying in roughly equal measure.

[**Rated 4.6 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/kingdomofthewicked)

---

## Does It Get Better After Book One?

Yes. Considerably. I'd estimate Throne of Glass is the weakest entry in the series — it's not bad, just the most conventionally YA, and it hasn't yet become the sprawling epic it turns into. Most readers who stick through to Crown of Midnight don't regret it.

## How Long Is It?

The main series runs to around 4,800 pages across eight volumes including the novella collection. Block out a few months. Or don't, and just accept you won't be sleeping much.
