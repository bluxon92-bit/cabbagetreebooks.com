The cover of The Atlas Six by Olivie Blake promises a captivating blend of science, magic, and a dark, brooding atmosphere. While this is indeed true, unfortunately, Blake fails to make it appealing to read about.

The Atlas Six follows the story of a secret society of magicians. Each year, six of the most powerful magicians are selected to attend, with the eventual goal of reducing their number to five (although the reason behind this is unclear). On the surface, this premise sounds intriguing and cool. However, disappointingly, that's all there is to the story.

## The Atlas Six Plot - 3/5

The potential for The Atlas Six was immense. With a group of powerful magicians, one would expect thrilling adventures that shape the world and involve villains and conspiracy theories. However, the book mostly consists of the characters talking to each other, engaging in personal issues typical of late teens or early twenties, and performing minimal magic.

The book begins with excitement as the characters are recruited and introduced to the society, showing some promise. However, it quickly devolves into 300 pages of nothingness. They argue, experience psychedelic episodes, debate who is expendable, and Blake attempts a weak twist at the end.

My scathing review stems from the wasted potential and untapped opportunities in this book. Blake's writing is impressive yet off-putting. It is well-structured, and her vocabulary is commendable, but it often feels more like reading someone's dissertation rather than a fictional book aimed at twenty-somethings seeking a Harry Potter-esque experience.

## The Atlas Six Characters - 4/5

It seems that Olivie Blake's focus in The Atlas Six was on the characters. With a lackluster plot and numerous character interactions in conversations, the intention was likely to build deep characters for readers to root for. However, I found it difficult to care about them.

Without delving into individual character details, the only character who held my interest was Libby Rhodes. She had the most compelling storyline and acted her age, unlike the brooding and overly serious individuals surrounding her. I did worry that she would enter into a relationship with Nico de Verona, another member of the Six, who had been consistently mean to her throughout their schooling.

Overall, the remaining characters appeared too serious and dull for my taste. The majority of the book revolves around discussions, deciding who should leave the group, and ultimately, characters engaging in romantic relationships. The purpose of it all remains unclear.

I have given the characters a four because Blake made a commendable effort to establish character relationships and depth. As mentioned, I did genuinely like Libby, who displayed more kindness and sensibility than the others.

## Final Rating for The Atlas Six by Olivie Blake - 3.5

The Atlas Six arrived with significant hype, boasting a fantastic premise and an enticing cover. It starts off strongly, but soon loses its way. After initial action sequences, there is a prolonged period of nothingness until Blake attempts to tie things together towards the end. Even then, it feels like the final chapters lack direction, merely setting up the possibility of a sequel. The Atlas Six receives one of the lowest ratings on my blog because it was dull and overly serious. I've heard the sequel is even worse, so this may mark the end of the series for me.
