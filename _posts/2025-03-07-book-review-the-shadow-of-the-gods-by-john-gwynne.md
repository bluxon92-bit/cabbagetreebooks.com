The Shadow of the Gods by John Gwynne immediately caught my attention after coming across a YouTube review. Intrigued by the premise, I stopped the video to avoid spoilers. Soon after, I discovered John Gwynne's name among the best active fantasy authors on a Twitter thread. Serendipitously, The Shadow of the Gods was on offer at that very moment, tying everything together seamlessly.

In this captivating tale, the first instalment of Gwynne's latest series, readers are transported to a world inspired by Norse mythology. The narrative follows the journeys of Orka, Elvar, and Varg, offering a truly immersive experience that showcases Gwynne's skill as a storyteller.

## The Shadow of the Gods Plot - 4.5/5

The Shadow of the Gods takes readers on a journey that intertwines the lives of three distinct individuals in a realm infused with Norse mythology. Orka's narrative delves into her relentless pursuit to uncover the truth behind her child's abduction and reunite with him. Elvar's story follows her quest to prove herself as a warrior within the esteemed Battle-Grim clan. Lastly, we join Varg, once a thrall, as he embarks on a quest for freedom and a place to call home.

The brilliance of these three narratives kept me eagerly turning the pages, anticipating the future of each protagonist. Gwynne excels in weaving intricate lore and profound depth without overwhelming the reader. The characters breathe life into the world, sharing tales and engaging in conversations that provide relatable context to the rich history surrounding them. This immersive approach makes readers feel like integral participants in this fresh and storied universe.

The individual stories within The Shadow of the Gods are masterfully crafted. Gwynne skillfully varies the pacing, seamlessly transitioning between action-packed sequences and intimate conversations that reveal the characters' innermost thoughts, enriching their development. The book delivers enchanting fantasy moments, featuring formidable monsters, exhilarating battles, and displays of bravery from the main protagonists that leave readers yearning for more.

## The Shadow of the Gods Characters - 5/5

Characters play a crucial role in the success of a book, and The Shadow of the Gods excels in this aspect. Gwynne's ability to construct a vibrant world through storytelling is matched by his talent for creating engaging and intriguing characters.

While the main characters generally maintain a serious demeanour, moments of levity emerge, particularly through Varg's wit. Their primary purpose, however, is to drive the plot forward, with occasional opportunities for comedic relief. Nevertheless, this does not undermine their depth or complexity. Gwynne skillfully reveals their backstories and personalities through actions, avoiding information dumps or clichéd dialogue. As readers delve deeper into their journeys, unexpected displays of emotion, tears welling up or anger flaring, reveal hidden depths and unforeseen connections.

Additionally, The Shadow of the Gods introduces well-executed comedy characters who alleviate the weight of the main characters' intense storylines and arduous journeys. Through amusing anecdotes and witty remarks, they inject much-needed lightness when required, skillfully diffusing tension.

The connection I felt to the characters in The Shadow of the Gods, reminiscent of my discovery of fantasy master Brandon Sanderson's works, is profound. Not only does the book capture the imagination through its world-building, but it also introduces a cast of characters who will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression, immersing readers in their captivating stories.
