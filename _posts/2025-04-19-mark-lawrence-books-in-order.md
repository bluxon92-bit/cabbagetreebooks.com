Mark Lawrence is one of the most prolific and interesting fantasy authors working today. He writes fast, he writes dark, and he writes with a precision that makes even his most extreme material feel purposeful. Since his debut in 2011 he's published five separate fantasy series set in connected or overlapping worlds, plus standalone novels and short fiction.

Here's everything in the order I'd recommend reading it.

---

## Where to Start

If you're new to Lawrence, start with either **The Broken Empire** (his debut trilogy, darkest and most divisive) or **The Book of the Ancestor** (his most accessible series, with a remarkable female protagonist). I'd lean toward The Book of the Ancestor for most readers.

---

## The Broken Empire Trilogy

Lawrence's debut. Set in a far-future world where civilisation has collapsed into pseudo-medieval feudalism, following Jorg Ancrath — one of fantasy's most extreme anti-heroes — from age thirteen to early adulthood. It's brilliant and genuinely not for everyone.

### 1. Prince of Thorns (2011)

The introduction to Jorg and the Broken Empire world. Violent, beautifully written, deliberately provocative. See our [full review here](https://www.cabbagetreebooks.com/blog/prince-of-thorns-review).

[**Rated 4.3 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/princeofthorns)

### 2. King of Thorns (2012)

Narrated from two timelines — Jorg at fourteen and Jorg at eighteen — and structured around a box of memories he can't open. Technically more ambitious than Prince of Thorns and arguably the more complex novel.

[**Rated 4.4 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/kingofthorns)

### 3. Emperor of Thorns (2013)

The conclusion. Everything the trilogy has been building toward resolves here, including the mystery of the world's true nature. Lawrence sticks the landing.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/emperoroftthorns)

---

## The Red Queen's War Trilogy

Set in the same world as The Broken Empire but following **Jalan Kendeth** — coward, womaniser, minor royal — and his unlikely companion, the Viking warrior Snorri. Much lighter in tone than the Jorg books, funnier, and almost shockingly charming given the shared world. Start here if the Jorg books sound too grim.

### 1. Prince of Fools (2014)

Jalan is sent on a quest he wants absolutely no part of. His narration is among the funniest in recent fantasy fiction.

[**Rated 4.3 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/princeoffools)

### 2. The Liar's Key (2015)

The quest continues. Snorri's backstory deepens. Jalan continues to be exactly as cowardly as he promised.

[**Rated 4.4 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/liarskey)

### 3. The Wheel of Osheim (2016)

The conclusion, involving one of fantasy's more inventive takes on the underworld. Unexpectedly moving in its final act.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/wheelosheim)

---

## The Book of the Ancestor Trilogy

Lawrence's best series, and my personal recommendation for first-time readers. Set in a convent where warrior nuns are trained, following **Nona Grey** from childhood through to fully lethal adulthood. Gripping, brilliantly plotted, and with a world-reveal as satisfying as anything in the Broken Empire.

### 1. Red Sister (2017)

Nona arrives at the Convent of Sweet Mercy under a death sentence. She turns out to be rather good at the curriculum. The school sections are some of Lawrence's best writing.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/redsister)

### 2. Grey Sister (2018)

The stakes escalate. Nona grows into her powers. The world expands.

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/greysister)

### 3. Holy Sister (2019)

The conclusion. Lawrence has been constructing something intricate across three books and the finale reveals the full shape of it. Outstanding.

[**Rated 4.6 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/holysister)

---

## The Book of the Ice Trilogy

A companion series to Book of the Ancestor, following **Yaz** — a girl from a tribe living on the frozen surface of the world — as she descends into the tunnels beneath. Less immediately gripping than Book of the Ancestor but rewards patience and deepens the world significantly.

### 1. The Girl and the Stars (2020)
### 2. The Girl and the Mountain (2021)
### 3. The Girl and the Moon (2022)

[**Buy the series on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/girlandstars)

---

## The Library Trilogy

Lawrence's most recent series, lighter in tone, set in a world-spanning library. Still in progress.

### 1. The Book That Wouldn't Burn (2023)

[**Rated 4.5 Stars. Buy on Amazon.**](https://amzn.to/bookwouldntburn)

---

## Connected Worlds

All five series take place in the same universe, though you don't need to read them in any particular order. Attentive readers will spot connections and shared mythology across the series — Lawrence has clearly been building a larger picture over his entire career.
