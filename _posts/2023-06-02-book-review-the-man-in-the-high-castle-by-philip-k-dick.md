What if the Nazis had emerged victorious and conquered America? How would life be if the Japanese ruled alongside them, while other races suffered under slavery and discrimination? These are the themes explored in Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle.

As one of the most renowned science fiction authors of all time, Philip K. Dick weaves together the separate narratives of three main characters in an alternate 1960s where Germany and Japan won World War II. I must admit that I watched the Amazon Prime TV series before reading the book, which may have slightly influenced my experience with the novel.

## The Man in the High Castle Plot - 4/5

The story follows the journeys of three or four main characters, each navigating the alternative reality of 1960s America under the new regime. One character is a high-ranking politician, offering insights into the political landscape and decision-making of this alternate reality. Another character is a Jew who must conceal his identity and navigate life in a society that discriminates against his kind. We also follow a man involved in selling war memorabilia and his struggles in a climate of oppression. Finally, the most intriguing storyline involves a woman who discovers a book describing an alternate reality where Germany lost the war (our own reality).

Apart from the narrative about the alternate reality book, the other stories failed to captivate me, particularly the storyline of the jeweler, which seemed unclear in purpose. I found enjoyment in the politician's tale as it delved into the ruling methods and harsh decisions of the German regime. I loved the idea and overall premise, however, I felt that the book didn't fully utilise the potential of this fascinating idea.

## The Man in the High Castle Characters - 3.5/5

I can't say that I particularly enjoyed any of the characters in this book. They all seemed to possess mundane personalities, rarely cracking jokes or displaying much beyond worry and pessimistic thoughts. While this could be interpreted as clever character design by Philip K. Dick, reflecting the oppressive environment they inhabit, it is worth noting that they have lived under this regime for twenty years, and one might expect them to have adjusted somewhat.

The gentleman involved in selling antiques was the only character whose internal monologues felt relatable and showcased some personality traits. He constantly worries about others' opinions of him, panics easily, and struggles to think optimistically within his job. However, overall, if you're looking for characters to fall in love with, this book may disappoint.

## Summary of The Man in the High Castle - 3.5/5

As evident, I was deeply disappointed by this book. However, as I mentioned earlier, I read it after watching the Amazon Prime series. The TV adaptation explores the potential of this alternate world far more effectively, delving into the politics, danger, and scheming that would inevitably unfold under Nazi rule.

While being a shorter book can sometimes be a hindrance, I have read other books of similar length that I thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. I wouldn't dissuade anyone
