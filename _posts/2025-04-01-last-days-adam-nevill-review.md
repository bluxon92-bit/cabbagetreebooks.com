Adam Nevill is the most consistently frightening horror writer working in Britain today. He doesn't have King's mainstream reach or Hill's crossover appeal, but in terms of raw capacity to produce genuine dread he's in the first rank of anyone writing horror fiction anywhere. *Last Days* is the best place to start with him.

## What's It About?

Kyle Freeman is a struggling documentary filmmaker. He's offered an unusual commission: travel to three locations connected to a 1970s death cult called the Temple of the Last Days and film whatever he finds there. The cult ended in mass suicide. Something is supposedly still present at the sites.

Kyle needs the money badly enough to take the job. He travels to a farmhouse in France, a remote Welsh property, and an abandoned building in the American southwest. At each location he films. At each location, things happen that don't have sensible explanations.

The found-footage structure — Kyle is making a documentary, so we're ostensibly watching him film — is used with more intelligence than the format usually receives. Nevill understands that what makes found-footage horror work is the implication of authenticity, and he builds that implication carefully.

---

## The Dread

Nevill's great skill is environmental horror. The farmhouse in France is rendered with real attention to physical detail — its smell, its darkness, the quality of its silence — and that attention makes the intrusions of the supernatural land with full impact. You believe in the space before you believe in what happens there, which is exactly the right order of operations.

The things Kyle encounters don't announce themselves. There's no jump-scare architecture. The horror creeps, accumulates, and by the time the novel's final act arrives it has built to something oppressive.

---

## The Cult

The Temple of the Last Days mythology — the figure the cult worshipped, the practices they engaged in, the reason they ended the way they did — is revealed gradually through Kyle's research and through what he films. Nevill is good at this kind of historical horror: the sense that something terrible happened in a place and left a residue. The cult feels real in a way that makes their supernatural legacy feel real.

---

## What Doesn't Quite Work

The middle section, moving between the three locations, is repetitive by design — Kyle encounters something at each site, and the pattern is similar each time. This is structurally intentional (the accumulation is the point) but some readers find it frustrating rather than escalating.

Kyle himself is a thin protagonist. He's a functional lens rather than a rounded character, and Nevill doesn't invest the same care in him as in the locations and mythology.

---

## Should You Read It?

If you want British horror that takes itself seriously and delivers genuine scares — yes. Nevill's other novels worth investigating: *The Ritual* (probably his most famous, involving a hiking trip gone very wrong in Scandinavian woods) and *No One Gets Out Alive* (a woman trapped in a terrible boarding house, which sounds simple and is devastating).

**Rating: 4/5**
