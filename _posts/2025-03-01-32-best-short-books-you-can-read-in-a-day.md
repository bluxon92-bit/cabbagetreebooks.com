## Final Words: Finding The Best Short Book

We don’t always have the time (or headspace) to dig into a masterpiece like War and Peace. But, sometimes you want to lay the easy fantasy aside, step away from yet another formulaic murder mystery and tackle something with a little more guts, something that’s going to give you a bit to chew on, but isn’t going to take six months of effort to get through (I say as I tuck Ulysses back under my bed to remain unread for yet another year).

This is why you’re here, looking for the best short book recommendations. And that’s what this list of 32 of the best short books aims to do—provide you with options to add to your TBR list without feeling like a lifelong commitment to the unravelling of dense Dickensian prose.

From the harrowing isolation in William Golding's Pincher Martin to the lyrical beauty of Anne Carson's The Autobiography of Red, each book here is a golden example of the power of brevity. Short reads that pack the punch of much longer works.
